How does Chinas headofstate diplomacy guide its majorcountry diplomacy with Chinese characteristics? Mao Ning Under the strategic guidance of headofstate diplomacy, majorcountry diplomacy with Chinese characteristics embarked on a new journey and has written a splendid new chapter in . First, China has advanced majorcountry relations. This years headofstate overseas visits kicked off with President Xi Jinpings visit to Russia. The Chinese and Russian presidents had long, sincere, friendly, and fruitful talks and exchanges, and drew up a blueprint for the growth of ChinaRussia relations. President Xi was invited to hold the ChinaUS summit meeting in San Francisco. The two sides had an exchange of views on strategic and overarching issues critical to the direction of ChinaUS relations and on major issues affecting world peace and development to stabilize and improve the bilateral relations. President Xi had meetings with French president and EU leaders. They exchanged views and reached important common understandings on ChinaFrance relations, ChinaEU relations, and regional and international issues of mutual concern. Second, China has enhanced solidarity and cooperation with neighbors and developing countries. In Xian, President Xi chaired the ChinaCentral Asia Summit, where all parties jointly announced that they will build a closer ChinaCentral Asia Community with a shared future. In Johannesburg, President Xi attended the th BRICS Summit, where BRICS expansion made a historic step forward. He cochaired with South African President the ChinaAfrica Leaders Dialogue, which demonstrated through concrete action that China and African countries will forever stand shoulder to shoulder. In Beijing, President Xi announced eight major steps China will take to support the joint pursuit of highquality Belt and Road cooperation at the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation to help developing countries speed up the process of modernization. In Hanoi, General Secretary and President Xi reached important common understandings with Vietnamese leaders to build a ChinaViet Nam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance. It is another vivid illustration of the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in neighborhood diplomacy. Third, China contributed its wisdom to the settlement of hotspot issues. Based on the common understanding reached by President Xi and Saudi and Iranian leaders and with Chinas support and facilitation, Saudi Arabia and Iran reached a historic agreement to resume diplomatic ties. To facilitate the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, President Xi maintained communication with leaders from relevant parties to promote peace talks. Since the outbreak of the latest PalestinianIsraeli conflict, President Xi has outlined Chinas principled position on multiple occasions. At the Extraordinary Joint Meeting of BRICS Leaders, he called for an immediate ceasefire and efforts for an early solution to the question of Palestine that is comprehensive, just, sustainable and based on the twostate solution. Fourth, China has consolidated public foundation for friendly cooperation. President Xi Jinping personally reached out to the world to tell Chinas stories and make friends across the globe. Earlier this year, President Xi met with Henry Kissinger, Bill Gates and several other US friends, had cordial conversations with old friends from various sectors of the US in San Francisco, and delivered a historic speech to the American public while he was there. He also exchanged correspondence with friends from various countries. The letters conveyed messages of goodwill. It showed the character of a statesman who has a common touch and values the bond with the people. This has won respect and friendship from the world. President Xi Jinping once noted, Its hard work to travel all over the world, but weve made more and more friends because of it. This is our reward. As we conclude  with numerous highlights in headofstate diplomacy, let us look forward to next year.  Bloomberg Just on your earlier comments, I just wanted to ask about Ukraine andRussiaand the visit by Envoy Li Hui to the region. Has there been any followup on that or is there a further trip planned? I just wanted to ask about the Li Hui delegation and future plans in . Can we expect to see that continuing? Thats my first question. And secondly I just wanted to ask about the meeting on foreign policy conference this week that basically was setting the tone for Chinas diplomatic activities going forward. I wonder if you could just tell us a little bit more about that. And for example, can you elaborate a little bit about the timing? Why was this happening around now? And what would be the key message for the international audience that they should take away from the conference on foreign policy? Mao Ning On your first question, China will continue to promotepeace talks and facilitate the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. About whether there are planned visits by Special Envoy Li Hui next year and Chinas future mediation or actions, I have no information to share at the moment. If something is planned, well release the information when appropriate. Please check back for updates. On your second question, let me thank you for your interest in the conference. This has been indeed a very important event. The Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs was held in Beijing on December . Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Central Committeeof the Communist Party of China CPC, President of the Peoples Republic of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, delivered an important address. He gave a profound exposition onthe international environment and historical mission ofChinas external work on the new journey, and made comprehensive plans for Chinas external work for the present and coming periods. It was made clear at the conferencethat since the th CPC National Congress, historic achievements have been secured and historic changes have taken place in Chinas external workon the great journey of advancing the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. We haveopened up new prospects in majorcountry diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. China has become a responsible major country with enhanced internationalinfluence, stronger capacity to steer new endeavors, and greater moral appeal. Changes of the world, of our times, and of historical significance are unfolding like never before, and the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation. Yetthe overall direction of human development and progress will not change, the overall dynamics of world history moving forward amid twists and turns will not change, and the overall trend towarda shared future for the international community will not change. It waspointed out at the conference that a community with a shared future for mankind reflects the Chinese Communists worldview, perception of order,and values, accordswith the common aspiration of people inall countries, and points the direction for the progress of world civilizations. It is also the noble goal pursued by China in conducting majorcountry diplomacy with Chinese characteristics for the new era. Given the series of major issues and challenges facing the world today, China calls for anequal and orderly multipolar world and auniversally beneficial and inclusiveeconomic globalization. An equal and orderlymultipolar world is one in which all countries, regardless of size, are treated as equals, hegemonism and power politics are rejected, and democracy is truly promoted in international relations. Auniversally beneficial and inclusiveeconomic globalizationis one that meets the common needs of all countries, especially the developing countries, and properly addresses the development imbalances between and within countries resulting from the global allocation of resources. On the new journey, majorcountry diplomacy with Chinese characteristics will enter a new stage where much more can be accomplished. We will be guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era and Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy in particular. We must focus on the central task of the CPCand the country, seek progress while maintaining stability, break new ground while upholdingfundamental principles, and firmly safeguard Chinassovereignty, security and development interests. We will explore new frontiers in Chinas diplomatic theory and practice, foster new dynamics in the relations between China and the world, and raise Chinas international influence, appeal and power to shape events to a new level. We will create a more favorable international environment and provide more solid strategic support for building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinesenation on all fronts through the Chinese path to modernization. AFP According to Tony Chung on social media who was convicted under the National Security Law, he has arrived in the UK to seek asylum. Does the Foreign Ministry have any comment? Mao Ning Hong Kong upholds the rule of law. All laws in Hong Kong must be observed and those who break the law must be held accountable. Those who think they can just use foreign support and get away with legal consequences will not have their way and will be held accountable.  RIA Novosti In an interview with RIA news agency, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Western countries and some countries of the Global South met daysagoto discuss a peace formula proposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He added that Russias close allies who attended the meeting did not promise anyone to keep secrets from Russia on issues concerning it. Whats Chinas comment? Did China attend this meeting? Mao Ning Chinas position on the Ukraine crisis is clearcut and consistent. We have played a constructive role in bringing about a ceasefire and the political settlement of the crisis. The Chinese side will continue working in its own way to promote peace talks and facilitate political settlement at an early date. NHK A spokesperson of one of the local armed groups in Myanmar told NHK they communicated or coordinated with the Chinese authorities before they started the military operation in October against the Myanmar government. Can you confirm that? Is there any progress or updates on peace talks between Myanmar government forces and armed groups mediated by China? Mao Ning Chinas position on the conflict in northern Myanmar is very clear. China firmly supports the peace process in northern Myanmar and does not support any party in provoking trouble. Ceasefire and peace talks serve the interests of relevant parties in Myanmar and are conducive to peace and stability in the ChinaMyanmar border area. We hope relevant parties in Myanmar will exercise maximum restraint, take the initiative in deescalating the situation on the ground and jointly bring about a soft landing of the situation in northern Myanmar. Dragon TVIts reported that the spokesperson of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Aguilar said that the Philippino government is considering building a permanent civilian structure on Renai Jiao, such as a lighthouse or marine science research center. He also said that Renai Jiao lies in their Exclusive Economic Zone where only the Philippines can build structures. They will deliver civilian supplies rather than military supplies from now on. Whats your response? Mao Ning Renai Jiao is part of Chinas Nansha Qundao. China has indisputable sovereignty over Nansha Qundao, including Renai Jiao, and their adjacent waters. This was established in the long course of history and is consistent with international law including the UN Charter. It is against the principles of international law and legally untenable for the Philippines to cite the award of the South China Sea arbitration, which is illegal, null and void, to claim that Renai Jiao falls within its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf and deny Chinas sovereignty over it. Renai Jiao is an uninhabited shoal. According to the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea DOC signed by China and ASEAN countries, parties should keep Renai Jiao uninhabited and facilityfree. On the Renai Jiao issue, the Philippines reneged on its words, changed its policy, infringed on Chinas sovereignty and made provocations again and again and triggered complex situations. The spokesperson of the Armed Forces of the Philippines blatantly claimed that the Philippines will build a permanent structure. This would be another major move the Philippines could take to go back on its words, change its policy, and undermine the uninhabited and facilityfree status of Renai Jiao. This will severely infringe on Chinas sovereignty, andviolate international law and the DOC. China will take resolute measures against any violation of our sovereignty and provocation, and firmly safeguard our territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.  The following question was raised after the regular press conferenceIts been learned that firing broke out in front of the Crown Hotel in Dong Chen, Laukkaing Township, Myanmar on the afternoon of December , causing casualties that included Chinese. The Myanmar government urged the Chinese nationals in Laukkaing to leave the country. Chinas embassy and consulates have issued a consular notice on this. Whats your comment? Mao Ning China is closely following the conflict in northern Myanmar and strongly deplores the casualties of Chinese caused by the armed conflict. We have lodged serious protest to relevant parties. We once again urge parties to the conflict in northern Myanmar to stop the fighting at once, take concrete steps to protect the safety and security of Chinese projects and personnel in Myanmar and stop events endangering the safety of lives and property of Chinese nationals from happening again. The current security situation in the Kokang selfadministered zone in Myanmar is severe and complex. The Foreign Ministry reminds Chinese citizens not to travel to northern Myanmar for the time being and calls on Chinese nationals in the area to take safety precautions. Its quite possible that those still in Laukkaing are telecom fraud suspects. What will China do with those people? Mao Ning China puts the people and their lives above all else. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese nationals overseas. We hope relevant parties in Myanmar to take Chinas concerns seriously and take concrete steps to protect the safety and security of Chinese projects and personnel in Myanmar. We call on the telecom fraud suspects in Laukkaing to return to China and turn themselves in as soon as possible so that there is still a possibility of being granted leniency.  In observance of New Years Day holiday, our press conference will be in recess on Monday, January  and resumed on Tuesday, January . During the recess, you may still raise questions to the Spokespersons Office via fax, email or WeChat. This concludes the last regular press briefing of . This year, we held  press briefings and took more than , questions. I would like to take this opportunity to extend heartfelt thanks to you all for being here with us throughout the year. We look forward to working closely with you in the year ahead to communicate Chinas foreign policy to the world and help it better understand China. On behalf of the Department of Press, Communication and Public Diplomacy of the Foreign Ministry and my colleagues, let me wish you a happy new year, good health and success, and your families every happiness and all the best in .Thankyouandseeyounextyear."
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on December 28, 2023"," AFP Chinas Embassy in Myanmar today reminded all Chinese nationals in Laukkaing to evacuate soon. Can you share more information with us, including the possible further mediation by the Chinese side? Mao Ning The current security situation in the Kokang selfadministered zone in Myanmar is severe and complex. We would like to remind Chinese nationals not to travel to northern Myanmar and call on Chinese nationals already in the area, especially those in Laukkaing Township, to move to safety or return to China as soon as possible and take safety precautions. China believes that maintaining the momentum of ceasefire and peace talks serves the interest of relevant parties in Myanmar and helps ensure peace and tranquility at the ChinaMyanmar border area. China hopes that relevant parties in Myanmar will exercise maximum restraint, actively ease the situation on the ground, together realize the soft landing of the situation in northern Myanmar and take concrete actions to protect the safety and security of Chinese projects and personnel in Myanmar. Shenzhen TV The UKbased Financial Times reported earlier that China is imposing a lengthy approval process and strict requirements to impede projects that lay and maintain undersea cables through the South China Sea. This has forced cable companies to reroute and bypass the South China Sea. Nikkei also reported that owing to the lengthy approval by Chinas competent authorities, the progress of some cable projects through the South China Sea has been slowed down. Whats your comments? Mao Ning Undersea cables are critical infrastructure for global data flow and carry around  percent of the worlds intercontinental communications traffic. They are the most important type of information carrier in international communications. Over the years, China has enhanced international exchanges and cooperation in cyberspace and actively advanced the construction of undersea cables and other types of global information infrastructure. China has implemented the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in letter and in spirit, and issued the Sea Areas Administration Law, the Marine Environment Protection Law, the Provisions Governing the Laying of Submarine Cables and Pipelines, the Provisions Governing the Protection of Submarine Cables and Pipelines and other relevant laws and regulations, which identify countries rights and obligations in laying cables in waters under Chinas jurisdiction in accordance with the law. They provide sound legal safeguards to international undersea cables that travel through waters under Chinas jurisdiction. China welcomes and supports other countries and telecommunication companies in laying international undersea cables in waters under Chinas jurisdiction. We encourage such collaboration between Chinese companies and their foreign counterparts. China will continue to work with the international community to strengthen bilateral, regional and international dialogue and cooperation, actively advance the building of global information infrastructure including undersea cables, jointly protect the cables, and boost global digital connectivity. We will jointly build a fairer and more equitable, secure, stable and vibrant cyberspace and a community with a shared future in cyberspace. "

Cooperation for better livelihood has yielded fruitful outcomes. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Headquarters that China helped to build completed construction early this year. Small but practical livelihood projects, such as the Luban Workshop, the Brightness Action, programs on growing Juncao and hybrid rice and cooperation on artemisinin have brought sustained benefit to our fellow developing countries and had an extensive and positive impact. Cooperation in new areas, such as green and digital areas, is booming. China and relevant countries have jointly issued the Beijing Initiative for Belt and Road Green Development and the Beijing Initiative on Belt and Road International Digital Economy Cooperation, stepped up industrial cooperation in green energy such as hydro power, wind power and photovoltaic power, and reinvigorated traditional industries through such digital economy platforms as the Silk Road ecommerce.

At the forum, President Xi Jinping reviewed achievements of the past decade and the good experience and announced eight major steps China will take to support the joint pursuit of highquality Belt and Road cooperation. This identified the direction, new vision and the source of impetus for BRI. We hope the th anniversary of BRI can be a new starting point for highquality Belt and Road cooperation and galvanize efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.  China Daily Several overseas media reported that a commander of the Baloch National Army that had surrendered himself to the Pakistani government disclosed that India has been secretly supporting terrorist activities in Balochistan and financing Balochistan separatist forces. Baloch officials said that Indias support and use of terrorists is the main reason behind the increasing terrorist activities in the province. Whats your comments? Mao Ning We noticed relevant reports. Terrorism is humanitys common enemy. China firmly opposes double standards on counterterrorism. To support and use terrorist groups and let them thrive out of ones selfish interests at the expense of international and regional security benefits no one and will only backfire. China stands for strengthening counterterrorism cooperation among all countries to jointly fight all forms of terrorism. AFP Zambias foreign minister resigned yesterday due to suspicion of taking bribes from a Chinese businessman. Could you share more information on this or your comment?

Zambia is Chinas important partner in Africa and we will continue working with Zambia to expand and deepen bilateral cooperation in various fields and advance common development. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on December 26, 2023"," China News Service Premier Li Qiang attended the fourth LancangMekong Cooperation LMC Leaders Meeting on December . Do you have more information to share about the meeting and the outcomes of the meeting? Mao Ning Yesterday, the fourth LancangMekong Cooperation LMC Leaders Meeting was held via video link. The meeting was a success. Premier Li Qiang and the leaders of the five Mekong countries attended the meeting. Focusing on the theme Join Hands on the Building of a Community of Shared Future and Modernization among LancangMekong Countries, the leaders took stock of the progress of LancangMekong cooperation and jointly planned for the future of the LMC. Premier Li pointed out that over the past seven years since the launch of the LancangMekong cooperation mechanism, under the strategic guidance of President Xi Jinping and the leaders of the Mekong countries, the six countries have built a powerful engine to promote development, a solid backing for common security, and a strong bond of mutual understanding. In particular, China announced with Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam respectively the bilateral decision to build a community with a shared future, which will further boost efforts to build a LancangMekong community with a shared future and provides a great example for building a community with a shared future for mankind. China put forward a fourpoint proposal on the future of the LMC. First, deepen integrated development and stick to openness and cooperation. China will launch a special loan for LMC common development to support the key projects in each country. Second, promote green cooperation. The six countries need to fully respect each others legitimate right to develop and utilize water resources rationally and advance cooperation in energy transition and ecological conservation.

China Review News On December  local time, US President Joe Biden signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year , which contains negative Chinarelated content. Whats Chinas comment? Mao Ning Despite Chinas opposition, the US passed and signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  that contains negative Chinarelated content. China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this and has made serious dmarches to the US side. The Act interferes in Chinas internal affairs, preaches US military support to Taiwan, and violates the oneChina principle and the three ChinaUS joint communiqus. We urge the US to honor the commitment of its leader of not supporting Taiwan independence, stop manipulating the Taiwan question and stop endangering peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. The Act pictures China as a threat, suppresses Chinese companies and limits normal economic, trade and peopletopeople exchanges between China and the US, which serves no ones interest. The US needs to abandon the Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice and create a favorable environment for ChinaUS cooperation in trade and other sectors. We urge the US to work with China to deliver on the important outcome and common understandings of the San Francisco summit. Negative Chinarelated content in the Act should not be implemented. If the US insists on going ahead with it, China will take resolute and strong measures to firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security and development rights and interests.  Al Jazeera Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in his speech on Monday that he asked China to do more to free an Israeli hostage held by Hamas. Can you confirm that and provide more details? Does China plan to mediate for this? Mao Ning Since the ongoing PalestinianIsraeli conflict broke out, China has repeatedly called for the release of all those held captive as soon as possible and has been making active efforts for this. We will work with the international community to continue to play a constructive role for realizing a ceasefire and the release of all those held captive. Al Jazeera The Prime Minister also said that he asked China and Russia to make greater effort for releasing the Israeli hostage. Can the Foreign Ministry confirm this? Mao Ning China is in communication with all parties on relevant issues and stands ready to work with all sides to facilitate the release of all those held captive as soon as possible and the realization of a ceasefire to bring lasting peace to the Middle East. AFP Indonesian police said today that the death toll following the explosion of a Chinesefunded plant in Indonesia rose to  and dozens are being treated in the hospital. Can you give us more details? Mao Ning In the wake of the accident, our Ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia immediately contacted Indonesia and made every effort jointly to respond to the accident. The Embassys task force together with Indonesian officials arrived at the scene in the industrial park yesterday to provide the company concerned with guidance on dealing with the accident. We will continue to work with competent authorities and local government to assist the Embassy in staying in close communication with Indonesia and make sure that everything is properly handled. As to the details about injuries and deaths, we are still in the process of collecting and verifying the information. Asahi TV Today marks the th anniversary of the birth of Chairman Mao Zedong. Will the Foreign Ministry hold commemoration for the occasion? Mao Ning Comrade Mao Zedong was at the core of the first generation of CPC central collective leadership and a great man deeply loved and respected by the whole Party and people of all ethnic groups in China. Across China, various forms of commemoration activities are held today. Reuters Russian media Kommersant reported yesterday that foreign shareholders in a project controlled by Russias Novatek, suspended the participation. This is the Arctic LNG  project and this is due to sanctions. Has Chinese participation through state oil majors like CNOOC and China National Petroleum Corp, in this project ended? And if so, how might this impact the ties between China and Russia? Mao Ning China and Russia conduct normal economic and trade cooperation on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. Such cooperation should not become the target of any intervention or restriction by a third party. What has happened shows that sanction and pressuring does not serve to achieve anything but can only cause negative spillover. We oppose unilateral sanctions and longarm jurisdiction that lack basis in international law and UN Security Council mandate. China and Russia will remain committed to normal economic and trade cooperation based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.  Xinhua News Agency The US issued an annual human rights report related to Xinjiang and sanctioned Chinas two officials and three companies. China said it will take resolute countermeasures. What are these specific measures? Mao Ning By issuing the report, the US once again spread false stories on Xinjiang and illegally sanctioned Chinese officials and companies citing socalled human rights issues. This move constitutes grave interference in Chinas internal affairs and violates the international law and the basic norms of international relations. The move is designed to vilify China and harmful to the lawful rights and interests of relevant Chinese officials and companies. We firmly oppose and strongly condemn the move and have made serious dmarches to the US over this. In accordance with Chinas AntiForeign Sanctions Law, we will take countermeasures against American intelligence data company Kharon, which has long collected Xinjiangrelated sensitive information and provided socalled evidence for Americas illegal sanctions related to Xinjiang, Edmund Xu, director of investigations of Kharon, and Nicole Morgret, former researcher of the Center for Advanced Defense Studies. The two persons will be prohibited from entering China including Chinas mainland, the Hong Kong SAR and the Macau SAR. China will freeze the property of Kharon and the two persons in China, including their movable and immovable property, and prohibit organizations and individuals in China from transactions and cooperation with them. We again urge the US to stop smearing China, cancel the illegal unilateral sanctions on Chinese officials and companies, and stop implementing wrongful acts such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. If the US refuses to change course, China will not flinch and will respond in kind. CCTV President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Viet Nam not long ago. This is a capstone in headofstate diplomacy this year and an important practice of Chinas principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in neighborhood diplomacy. How will China advocate this principle and consolidate friendship and cooperation with neighboring countries? Mao Ning This year marks the th anniversary of the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in neighborhood diplomacy. Over the past decade, China has actively implemented this important principle and put neighborhood diplomacy front and center in foreign relations. President Xi Jinping has drawn up a blueprint for Chinas exchanges with neighboring countries, visited them, and guided the expanding landscape of goodneighborliness and friendship. China has established strategic cooperative partnership with extensive neighboring countries and reached common understandings with more than ten countries on building a community with a shared future. General Secretary and President Xi Jinpings successful state visit to Viet Nam is another vivid illustration of Chinas principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in neighborhood diplomacy. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, China will continue to advocate the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness, and deepen friendship, cooperation and intertwined interests with neighboring countries. We will carry forward Asian values featuring peace, cooperation, inclusiveness and integration and provide new assistance for solidarity, openness and progress in the region. We are ready to deliver more benefits to neighboring countries through Chinese modernization, jointly advance the modernization drive in Asia, and build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful, amicable and harmonious Asian home with other countries in the region. Reuters The Philippines said today that the country is not provoking conflict in the South China Sea. This is in response to Chinas accusation that Manila is encroaching on Beijings territory. Our question is if the Philippines constant denials and rejection of Chinas warnings in South China Sea go on indefinitely, does China have any bottom line at all on this issue? And if so, what is Chinas bottom line to this? Mao Ning The recent developments involving China and the Philippines in the South China Sea are caused by the Philippines change of policy and position, refusing to honor its commitment, violation of the international law and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and deliberate infringement of Chinas sovereignty and provocations. The responsibility lies with the Philippines. China will resolutely protect its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. We hope that the Philippines will make the wise choice, return to the right track of properly handling disputes through dialogue and consultation, and work with China to properly handle and manage the situation at sea.

At the same time, we have seen bloc confrontation, decoupling and supply chain disruptions and other manifestations of Cold War mentality on the rise. Some people commented that the world is dividing into two blocs. Against this backdrop, how will China deepen and substantiate the vision? What role can the vision play in addressing current global challenges? Mao Ning Ten years ago, faced with profound changes of the world, of our times, and of the historical trajectory, President Xi Jinping put forward the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind. Over the past decade, the vision has been translated from ideas into actions, and has provided effective safeguard for preserving world peace, injected vigorous impetus into promoting global development, and built strong synergy for addressing global challenges. It has been warmly echoed by the international community. The vision has been written into resolutions of UN General Assembly for seven years in a row, and included in resolutions or declarations of multilateral mechanisms like the SCO and BRICS. China also put forward important initiatives such as building a global community of health for all, a community with a shared future in cyberspace, and a community of life for humanity and nature, giving a strong boost to global governance in various sectors. Today, we are living in the same global village. The connections and interdependence between countries around the world are more frequent and closer than ever. No country can stay unaffected in the face of various pressing global challenges. The vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind replaces conflicts and confrontation with peaceful development, absolute security with common security, and zerosum game with mutual benefits and winwin results, prevents cultural clashes through cultural exchanges, and champions green development to protect the planet we call home. The vision responds to the common pursuit of people in countries around the world for peace, development and cooperation, and identifies the fundamental path to solve global issues. Under the guidance of the vision, China has proposed and promoted the implementation of major initiatives including the Belt and Road cooperation, Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative. China stands ready to make joint efforts with the international community to build an open, inclusive, clean, and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security, and common prosperity, and create a better future for humanity.  Rudaw Media Network Over the past two months, there have been more than  attacks on US bases in Iraq and Kurdistan region. You are Iraqs trade partner. Are you concerned regarding the safety and security of Chinese companies operating in Iraq? Mao Ning Iraq is Chinas important Belt and Road partner. In recent years, China and Iraq have deepened practical cooperation, delivering tangible benefits to the two countries and two peoples. China closely follows Iraqs security situation and is willing to increase cooperation with Iraq to ensure the safety and smooth progress of cooperation projects. Reuters Chinas official media today accused the Philippines of repeatedly violating Chinas sovereignty in the South China Sea, spreading false news and colluding with foreign forces to undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea. Will the two sides hold a new round of talks? How does China view the risk of armed maritime conflict? Mao Ning China will not weaken in its resolve to protect its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. For months, the Philippines has been making provocations on Renai Jiao and other issues and drawing forces outside the region into those issues. China is compelled under those circumstances to take necessary measures to firmly respond to it. That said, Chinas door of dialogue remains open. We are ready to work with the Philippines to properly handle maritime issues through negotiation and consultation. We hope the Philippines will stop pursuing the wrong course at once. AFP At least  persons were killed yesterday in Indonesia in an explosion at the Chinese funded plants. Can you tell us if some Chinese nationals were among the victims? Mao Ning Weve learned that the accident has so far killed , including four Chinese employees and injured many who have been taken to hospital. Were saddened by the deaths and injuries and express our condolences over the victims. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs are working closely with other government agencies and relevant local government in China on the matter.

The Embassy is also giving guidance to the company concerned on followup arrangements. We will stay in close communication with Indonesia to make sure that everything is properly handled. China News Service We noticed that on December  local time, the th UN General Assembly adopted a resolution by consensus to list the Lunar New Year as a UN floating holiday, which means the lunar new year will be celebrated at the UN too. Any comment on that? Mao Ning The Lunar New Year, or what we call Spring Festival in China, is the oldest and the most important traditional festival in the Chinese culture. Its a time for family reunion and ringing in the new year. Its celebrated in China and around the world. Some rough estimates suggest that the Lunar New Year is a public holiday in almost  countries and celebrated in various ways by about onefifth of humanity. Traditional Lunar New Year activities are organized in nearly  countries and regions. The festival has become a global cultural event, bringing joy to people around the world. The Lunar New Year symbolizes joy, harmony and peace and its Chinese name Spring Festival conveys the greetings and warmth of the spring season. The festival embodies the core values of harmony, love and peace in Chinese culture. We look forward to celebrating the Spring Festival with the world and hope all civilizations will live in harmony, prosper together and engage in exchanges and mutual learning, and that people of all countries will enjoy better mutual understanding and friendship and work together for building a community with a shared future for mankind.  Global Times It is reported that the Japanese government adopted the updated Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology and its implementation guidelines herein referred to as Three Principles on December  with a decision to provide its homemade Patriot air defence missiles to the United States. It is the first time that Japan has allowed the export of destruction weapons since its Cabinets adoption of the Three Principles in . On the same day, the Cabinet approved the budget for Fiscal Year  with a record defense budget of around JPY . trillion, up by . percent year on year. What is your comment? Mao Ning Given Japans recent history of militarist aggression, Japans military and security moves are closely watched by its Asian neighbors and the international community. In recent years, Japan has been drastically readjusting its security policy, increasing defense spending year after year, easing the restrictions on arms export and seeking military breakthroughs. We urge Japan to earnestly respect the security concerns of neighboring countries, reflect on its history of aggression, commit itself to the path of peaceful development and earn the trust of its Asian neighbors and the wider international community through concrete actions. The Paper Last Friday, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution  on the humanitarian condition in Gaza, with  votes in favor and two abstentions. How does China see the resolution? Mao Ning Resolution  is the second Security Council resolution since the ongoing PalestinianIsraeli conflict broke out. The resolution calls for urgent action to expand humanitarian assistance to Gaza and creating the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities. For publicly known reasons, the resolution does not quite come up to international expectations and has certain gaps that needed to be filled. Yet in light of the urgent situation on the ground and the position of Palestine and other Arab countries, China voted in favor of the resolution. The latest round of PalestinianIsraeli conflict has already killed and injured tens of thousands of innocent civilians and the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. We hope the resolution will be effectively implemented, more humanitarian aid will reach Gaza as soon as possible and a monitoring mechanism will be set up. That said, realizing a ceasefire remains the absolute priority and prerequisite for everything else. China will continue to work with all parties to enhance coordination and galvanize more responsible and meaningful actions in the Security Council to make relentless efforts for an early cessation of hostilities in Gaza, the implementation of the twostate solution and peace and stability in the Middle East. Beijing Daily Its reported that two employees working for Vivos India unit were arrested by Indias Enforcement Directorate. They will next appear in court on December .

Recently, its also said that Chinese staff of the ZTEs India unit might soon be forced to leave India because they could not get visa or the visa extension permit. Whats your comment? Mao Ning We are closely following what you mentioned. The Chinese government firmly supports Chinese businesses in safeguarding their lawful rights and interests. We hope that India will fully recognize the mutually beneficial nature of the business cooperation between our two countries and provide a fair, just, transparent and nondiscriminatory business environment. The Chinese embassy and consulates in India will continue to provide consular protection and assistance to the individuals concerned in accordance with the law. "

Whats Chinas expectation for this meeting? Wang Wenbin The LancangMekong Cooperation LMC is the first new subregional cooperation mechanism focused on building a community with a shared future with wide consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits of the six LancangMekong countries. In the past seven years since its inception, LMC enjoyed rapid development and put in place an LMC framework guided by leaders and underpinned by allround cooperation and broad participation. With progress and results delivered daily, monthly and annually, we have created an LMC speed, and fostered an LMC culture featuring equality, sincerity, mutual assistance and kinship. LMC has become a stellar example for countries to develop relations with each other, conduct regional cooperation and pursue SouthSouth cooperation. LancangMekong countries are at an important stage of speeding up development and achieving modernization. At the eighth LMC Foreign Ministers Meeting held earlier this month, parties focused on regional stability and prosperity, highlighted the growth of new development advantages in the region and made full preparation for the upcoming Leaders Meeting.

NBC Its reported that Chinese leader said China will reunify Taiwan with the mainland. While this is a known policy position, does this raising of the Taiwan issue in such a direct manner at the highest level with the United States imply that there is a change in Chinas tone or determination on the Taiwan issue, in particular ahead of Taiwan election? Wang Wenbin During his meeting with President Biden in San Francisco this November, President Xi Jinping outlined Chinas principled position on the Taiwan question. The readout of the meeting was released soon after their discussion. President Xi pointed out that the Taiwan question remains the most important and most sensitive issue in ChinaUS relations. China takes seriously the positive statements made by the United States in the Bali meeting, and the US should match its action with its commitment of not supporting Taiwan independence, stop arming Taiwan and support Chinas peaceful reunification. It needs to be pointed out that resolving the Taiwan question and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration of all sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. Our position of advancing reunification is consistent, rocksolid and unshakable. China will realize reunification, and this is unstoppable. China Daily During the summit meeting in San Francisco, China and the United States agreed to establish a working group on counternarcotics cooperation and carry out counternarcotics cooperation. What specific measures has China taken so far? Wang Wenbin Carrying out counternarcotics cooperation is one of the important common understandings reached between the two Presidents during their meeting in San Francisco. To deliver on that, the US side has lifted sanctions on relevant Chinese law enforcement institute. Recently, China has been engaged in campaigns against fentanyl and its precursor chemicals, and cracked down on illegal and criminal activities involving the smuggling, illicit manufacturing, trafficking and abuse of fentanylrelated substances. We have carried out a sweeping inspection of key businesses, personnel and equipment. We have been working to clean up information about online sales of fentanyl, and strictly prevent the smuggling and trafficking of relevant chemical substances to protect peoples physical and mental health. The counternarcotics authorities of China and the US are resuming regular communication. The Chinese side has notified the US side of the progress made in USrelated law enforcement operations against narcotics. China has responded to US request for verifying clues on certain cases and taken action. The two sides are in close communication on setting up a working group on counternarcotics cooperation. I need to stress that progress in resuming ChinaUS counternarcotics cooperation has not come easy and needs to be doubly cherished by both sides. We hope that the US side will show sincerity, work with China in the same direction and continue to carry out practical counternarcotics cooperation based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.  Al Jazeera Lately, the Israeli authorities have been confiscating occupied territories in the name of urban development, especially the Palestinianowned land in East Jerusalem. Such practice violates international law and has become a fuse directly causing the escalation of the PalestinianIsraeli conflict, which undermines peace and sabotages the possibility of the twostate solution. What is Chinas position on Israels acts? As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, what measures can China take to stop these acts of Israel which violate international law? Wang Wenbin China opposes Israel building settlements on the occupied Palestinian territory. China opposes unilateral change to Jerusalems status and status quo shaped by history. We believe that the issue of Jerusalems status should be settled through negotiations by parties concerned in accordance with relevant UN resolutions. As PalestinianIsraeli tensions continue to escalate and risk of spillover of the conflict in Gaza heightens, relevant parties need to be prudent and avoid any move that might lead to escalation or get the situation to spiral out of control.

The two heads of state announced the establishment of strategic partnership between the two countries. This marks a capstone of Chinas effort this year to enhance friendship with Latin American countries. Can you share more details of Chinas cooperation with Nicaragua and with Latin American countries? Wang Wenbin President Xi Jinping and President Ortega jointly announced the establishment of strategic partnership between China and Nicaragua. This is a milestone event in the history of ChinaNicaragua relations. It serves the common interests of the two countries and the two peoples, and promotes the common development and prosperity of the two countries. Over the past two years since diplomatic ties were resumed, the two countries, guided by headofstate diplomacy, have steered bilateral relations in the right direction, cemented political mutual trust, increased strategic coordination and accelerated practical cooperation. Both countries have benefited from resuming diplomatic ties. The resumption and growth of relations with Nicaragua is an epitome of how China has deepened ties with Latin American and Caribbean countries in recent years. Costa Rica, Panama, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras have either established or resumed diplomatic relations with China, which reflects the trend of history and the times. More and more Latin American and Caribbean countries have joined highquality Belt and Road cooperation. They have shown support for and taken part in the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative and are part of the effort to build a community with a shared future for China and Latin American countries. Though China and Latin American and Caribbean countries belong to different hemispheres, we share closer ties and a common futuremost importantly because ChinaLatin American cooperation benefits both sides and delivers common development. China now has five free trade partners in Latin America. We began negotiations with Honduras on a free trade agreement less than four months after establishing diplomatic relations. China and Nicaragua completed negotiations on the free trade agreement within just one year, which will come into force on the first day of the new year. The agreement will bring more real benefits to the two peoples. The projects assisted by China or undertaken by Chinese companies on infrastructure, energy and power, and peoples livelihood, are the latest showcase of China and Latin America working together for peoples better lives. China always believes that Latin America is not a wrestling ground between different forces. We respects Latin American countries right to independently choosing development paths that suit their national conditions, and supports Latin American countries in seeking strength through solidarity and addressing issues in the region through Latin American ways. China stands ready to work with Latin America to deepen ChinaLatin America relations in a new era characterized by equality, mutual benefit, innovation, openness and more benefits for the people and further promote the building of the ChinaLatin America community with a shared future.

Its now widened a list of technologies that cannot be transferred overseas to include the processing of rare earth metals and magnets. Can you respond to that? Wang Wenbin Are you referring to the Catalogue of Technologies Prohibited and Restricted from Export released by relevant Chinese authorities? Bloomberg Why is China doing this? Wang Wenbin Chinas competent authorities have responded to that. The revision of the Catalogue of Technologies Prohibited and Restricted from Export is a routine update for China to adapt to the latest technological advancement and better manage technology trade. The revision reduced the catalogue from  to  items. China is committed to promoting reform and development through opening up. We are always ready to create enabling conditions for international economic and trade cooperation on the basis of ensuring national economic security and development interests. AFP Top US and China military officials spoke for the first time in more than a year yesterday. Do you have any details to offer and was Taiwan among the topic discussed?

China News Service Recently, US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said that in lunar exploration, he doesnt believe the Chinese have shown much of an interest in working with the United States and the space is a contested area. Whats your comment? Wang Wenbin Today, the spokesperson for the China National Space Administration CNSA has shared relevant facts and history of space cooperation between China and the US. You may refer to it. China is committed to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space. We are ready to have international space exchanges and cooperation with all countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, peaceful use and inclusive development and actively promote the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind in the field of outer space. We have always been open to having space exchanges and cooperation with the US. The two sides established mechanisms such as the working group on Earth science and space science cooperation and the ChinaUS Civil Space Dialogue. The US, however, views space cooperation with China from a Cold War perspective. US domestic legislation such as the Wolf Amendment, the US Innovation and Competition Act of  and the America COMPETES Act of  were adopted to limit and thwart space exchanges and cooperation with China. The US even imposed unilateral sanctions on relevant Chinese companies. This is the real reason impeding cooperation between the two sides. In the field of lunar and deep space exploration, China has actively advanced international cooperation. CNSA recently issued the CE Lunar Research Sample Distribution Guide and the Announcement of International Cooperation Opportunities for the Change Mission. We welcome scientists and researchers from the US and all other countries to apply in line with the procedures. If the US truly wants to advance space exchanges and cooperation with China, it needs to revoke and abolish relevant legislation, stop making irresponsible comments and take practical steps to remove the stumbling blocks on the path towards cooperation. Bloomberg The US Commerce Department will begin gathering of information on the Chinese production of legacy semiconductors. Those are not the advanced chips. Those are just like regular chips. Its looking to track how deeply reliant US companies have become on the technology from China. Theres a belief that China is underpricing the sale of legacy semiconductors. Can you respond to that? Wang Wenbin The global industrial and supply chains are shaped and developed by the laws of market and business choices combined. Any deliberate intervention to instrumentalize and weaponize economic and trade issues is a violation of the principles of market economy and fair competition and will pose risks to the security of global industrial and supply chains. It will hurt the interests of the whole world, including the US itself. The US needs to respect international trade rules and the principle of market economy and create enabling conditions for ChinaUS economic and trade cooperation. "

He predicted that higher and more resilient growth is within reach for China in . Whats your comments? Wang Wenbin We noted that interview. Lately, many international organizations like the IMF and the OECD have revised up their  growth projections for China and are confident in Chinas economic prospects next year. China is widely considered the biggest driver for the world economy. The research of the IMF shows that faster growth in China has positive spillovers on the rest of the world. A one percentage point increase in China would, on average, increase the level of output in other economies by . percent. China has a hyperscale market with the biggest potential in the world. Macroeconomic policies introduced by the Chinese government have given the economy a strong push. There is ample room for enhanced implementation of monetary and fiscal polices. Chinas deepening of reform and opening up across the board provides strong impetus for sustained sound economic development. A new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation in the world also presents a broad stage for the Chinese economy. All in all, there are more favorable conditions than adverse factors for Chinas development, the trend of economic rebound and sound longterm trajectory has not changed, and the factors and conditions supporting highquality development are increasing. We welcome businesses from around the world to continue coming to China for global success. We will continue to expand highlevel opening up, improve the business environment, step up intellectual property protection, form an open and globally competitive innovation ecosystem and share with the world Chinas development achievements. AFP On Tuesday, the spokesperson said that Chinas maritime disputes with the Philippines do not represent the entirety of the bilateral relationship and that China was willing to handle them through dialogue and consultation. However, yesterday, the Chinese side said the bilateral relationship is at a crossroads until the Philippines to proceed with caution. Can the Foreign Ministry provide a reason for this sudden change in the tone of the statement towards the Philippines? Wang Wenbin I suggest that you take another close look at the readout that we released on the phone call between Chinese and Philippine foreign ministers. It is absolutely wrong to think that there has been a major change in Chinas tone on the issue. Yesterday, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a phone call with Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo at the request of the Philippines. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that ChinaPhilippines relations face serious difficulty and the root cause lies in the Philippines change of policy and position, refusing to honor its commitment and repeated provocations that undermine Chinas legitimate and lawful rights and interests. The bilateral relationship is now at a crossroads. Where it will go depends on what choice will be made. The Philippines must be very prudent about it. On what you said, I would like to stress that when it comes to maritime disputes with our neighbors, Chinas position is consistent and clear without any change. Our commitment to properly managing disputes through dialogue and consultation has not changed. Our willingness to work with the Philippines to implement the previously reached understandings has not changed. Our policy of working with the Philippines and other ASEAN countries to safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea has not changed. Last but not least, our resolve to safeguard our sovereignty and legitimate rights and interests has not changed and will not change. We hope that the Philippines will decide rationally, follow the effective way for neighbors to get along with each other and work with China to properly handle and manage the situation at sea.  Bloomberg Reports show that the Chinese leader said Beijing would reunify with Taiwan, but the timing has not yet been decided. Can I get your reaction? Wang Wenbin During his meeting with President Biden in San Francisco this November, President Xi Jinping outlined Chinas principled position on the Taiwan question. He pointed out that the Taiwan question remains the most important and most sensitive issue in ChinaUS relations. China takes seriously the positive statements made by the United States in the Bali meeting, and the US side should take real actions to honor its commitment of not supporting Taiwan independence, stop arming Taiwan, and support Chinas peaceful reunification. RIA Novosti The US State Departments spokesperson Matthew Miller said earlier that the United States would welcome China playing a constructive role in trying to prevent attacks in the Red Sea. I wonder if China is ready to play more active role in ensuring security in the Red Sea region. Wang Wenbin The Red Sea is an important international trade route for goods and energy. Safeguarding the security and stability of the region serves the common interest of the international community. China stands for protecting the safety of international sea lanes and against causing disturbance to civilian ships. We believe relevant parties, especially major countries with influence, need to play a constructive and responsible role in keeping the shipping lanes safe in the Red Sea. AFP Given the continued fighting in Myanmar especially the fighting near planned development along the ChinaMyanmar economic corridor, does the Foreign Ministry have any new comments on the conflict there? Wand Wenbin We have repeated Chinas position on the situation in northern Myanmar. China has been working actively to get relevant parties in Myanmar to effectively implement what has been agreed, exercise maximum restraint, actively ease the situation on the ground, properly manage sporadic confrontation events during ceasefire and maintain the momentum of ceasefire and peace talks. China will continue its effort in helping to stop the fighting and promote talks in northern Myanmar and jointly work for a soft landing of the situation in northern Myanmar. We also hope that parties concerned in Myanmar will keep the ChinaMyanmar border area peaceful and stable and protect the safety and security of Chinese projects and personnel in Myanmar.  TASS Ukraine yesterday added China Railway Construction Corporation CRCC to the list of international sponsors of the war. Does the Foreign Ministry have any comment? Wang Wenbin On the Ukrainian issue, China always stands on the side of peace and justice. We firmly oppose relevant Ukraine agency adding Chinese company to the relevant list. We ask Ukraine to correct its mistake at once and undo the negative effect. Bloomberg Theres a report that the Biden administration is considering increasing trade tariffs, particularly on Chinese electric vehicles. Can you respond? Wang Wenbin China has made it very clear that there is no winner in a trade or tariff war. The US unilateral tariff increases are against the principles of market economy and fair competition and threaten global industrial and supply chain security. This is textbook protectionism and may have violated WTOs mostfavorednation principle and national treatment principle. China is strongly opposed to it. We urge the US to abide by WTO rules, uphold the trade order for fair competition and provide a fair, just and nondiscriminatory business environment for foreign companies. China will follow closely whats to happen and do whats needed to protect our lawful rights and interests. "

Can you share with us how China has contributed to green development through Belt and Road cooperation and what experience has been gained through such cooperation? Wang Wenbin The building of a Green Silk Road, an important part of highquality Belt and Road cooperation, follows the global trend of green and lowcarbon development, and provides experience and pathways for BRI partner countries in their effort to enhance environmental protection, tackle climate challenge and implement the UN  Agenda for Sustainable Development. The cooperation has shown strong vibrancy. Over the past decade, China has issued policy documents on enhancing environmental management for overseas projects, promoting the green development of Belt and Road cooperation, enhancing international cooperation on green energy, and stopping building new coalfired power projects overseas, and identified the priorities for the Green Silk Road. China has also worked with BRI partner countries to launch the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on Green Development, propose the Green Investment Principles for the BRI, and establish the BRI International Green Development Coalition as part of the effort to build platforms for extensive exchange and cooperation on green development and build up international consensus. By the end of last month, China has signed  SouthSouth cooperation documents on climate change with  partner countries, rolled out over  climate mitigation and adaptation projects with more than  partner countries including Ethiopia, Pakistan, Samoa, Chile and Egypt, and set up a number of lowcarbon demonstration zones. China also helped train over , environmental and climate professionals for more than  developing countries through projects such as the Green Silk Road Envoys Program. The vision and technology of green development have been integrated into a number of flagship projects, including the ChinaEurope Railway Express, MombasaNairobi Railway, ChinaLaos Railway, Indonesia Tsingshan Industrial Park and Vientiane Saysettha LowCarbon Demonstration Zone in Laos, providing a strong boost to energy saving, environmental protection and emission reduction, which has been widely commended by the people in relevant countries. Going forward, China will stay committed to the path of Chinese modernization featuring harmony between man and nature, work with BRI partner countries to make green a defining feature of highquality development, aim for high standard, more benefits for the people and sustainable growth, elevate and expand green development cooperation, advance international cooperation in addressing climate change and together protect the planet we call home.

Whats Chinas comment? Wang Wenbin The Chinese government always puts our people and their lives above all else and has been emphasizing the multiple challenges that gun proliferation has brought to socioeconomic development of countries and to regional and international peace and stability. The ratification of the Firearms Protocol is yet another major step taken by China to implement the Global Security Initiative, practice multilateralism and uphold international and regional peace and stability. China is one of the safest countries with the lowest crime rate and the fewest gun and bomb attacks. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a responsible member of the international community, China is ready to use the ratification of the Firearms Protocol as an opportunity to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with all parties in the field of small arms and light weapons, with an emphasis on enhancing relevant capacity building of developing countries, and take concrete steps to practice the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on December 19, 2023"," CCTV Egypts National Elections Authority announced the result of the presidential election on the night of December , Beijing time. Incumbent Egyptian President Abdel Fattah ElSisi was reelected. What is Chinas comment? Wang Wenbin We would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations on the smooth presidential election in Egypt and on the reelection of President ElSisi. We believe that under the leadership of President ElSisi, Egypt will achieve greater success in its national development. China and Egypt enjoy a traditional friendship. In recent years, under the strategic guidance of President Xi Jinping and President ElSisi, bilateral relations have entered the fast lane, with fruitful practical cooperation in various areas and everdeeper friendship between the two peoples. China views its relations with Egypt from a strategic height and longterm perspective. We would like to continue working with Egypt to firmly support each other, deepen and expand Belt and Road cooperation, and take the ChinaEgypt comprehensive strategic partnership to a new height. Bloomberg Can you comment on the UK government demanding consular access to Jimmy Lai, who is also a UK citizen? Wang Wenbin We have stated our position yesterday, and I would like to reiterate that Hong Kong follows the rule of law, any law in Hong Kong must be observed and those who break the law must be held accountable. Jimmy Lai is a major mastermind and participant of the antiChina riots in Hong Kong. He is an agent and pawn of the antiChina forces, and the person behind the previous instability in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong law enforcement and judicial authorities have handled and tried the case in accordance with the law. This is fully justified, legitimate and lawful. Attempts to smear, disturb and sabotage Hong Kongs national security law will not succeed. NHK The Foreign Ministry Spokesperson said on December  that with Chinas facilitation, Myanmars military and relevant parties reached agreement on a temporary ceasefire, but relevant UN agencies reported that the fighting still continues. How do you respond to this? Wang Wenbin China supports the peace process of northern Myanmar and has provided support and facilitation for dialogue and contact between relevant parties in Myanmar. Our position is consistent. China hopes that relevant parties in Myanmar can speed up efforts to implement what has been agreed, exercise maximum restraint, actively ease the situation on the ground, promptly manage sporadic confrontation events and together realize the soft landing of the situation in northern Myanmar.  Reuters According to Philippine media, Philippine President Marcos said that Philippine diplomatic efforts with China is heading in poor direction. Has the Philippines invited China for a new round of talks? Will China invite the Philippines for talks? What does Marcos mean by saying in poor direction? Wang Wenbin The recent events between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea are caused by deliberate infringement of Chinas sovereignty and the provocations of the Philippines. The responsibility lies with the Philippines. We will resolutely protect our territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. At the same time, maritime disputes do not represent the entirety of ChinaPhilippines relations. We stand ready to properly handle disputes through dialogue and consultation with the Philippines and will not close our door of dialogue and contact with the Philippines. We hope that the Philippines will make the right choice, seriously honor its commitment of properly handling disputes through dialogue and consultation and work with China to pursue the healthy and steady growth of bilateral ties and jointly safeguard peace and stability in the region. Beijing Daily Its reported that on December  local time, Serbian President Vucic declared the victory of the coalition around the ruling Serbian Progressive Party in parliamentary elections, which won more than half of the seats in the National Assembly, the number needed to form a government. Whats Chinas comment? Wang Wenbin We congratulate Serbia on its smooth parliamentary and local elections. We believe that under the leadership of President Vucic and the new government of Serbia, Serbia will continue to make new progress in national development. China attaches great importance to the growth of ChinaSerbia relations. We look forward to working with Serbia to consolidate our political mutual trust, deepen practical cooperation in various areas and bring ChinaSerbia comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level. Hubei Media Group Its reported that US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said at the Brookings Institution on December  that China has a wish to become more influential in the Middle East, but the work to end the conflict is really on US shoulders. Whats your comment? Wang Wenbin Since the PalestinianIsraeli conflict broke out, China has been committed to promoting a ceasefire, protecting the civilians and easing the humanitarian crisis. President Xi Jinping attended the BRICS extraordinary virtual summit on the PalestinianIsraeli issue, sent congratulatory messages to the UN special commemorative meeting in observance of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People for  consecutive years, and stated Chinas position on the PalestinianIsraeli conflict on multiple occasions. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi has had indepth exchange of views with leaders and senior officials of more than  countries and international organizations and traveled to New York to chair the UN Security Council highlevel meeting on the PalestinianIsraeli question. Chinas Special Envoy for the Middle East issue visited countries across the region, attended international conferences and widely engaged relevant countries. As the president of the Security Council in November, China enabled the adoption of the first Security Council resolution since the current PalestinianIsraeli conflict broke out, submitted the Position Paper of the Peoples Republic of China on Resolving the PalestinianIsraeli Conflict and worked to galvanize more support and action from the Security Council. China has provided multiple batches of aid, including humanitarian cash assistance, food and medicine, to the people in Gaza. I want to stress that China does not have selfish interests in the Middle East and does not seek to form exclusive blocs in the region. China always supports the people in Middle East countries in keeping the regions future in their own hands. China stands ready to work with ArabIslamic countries to firmly support the Palestinian peoples just cause of restoring their lawful national rights. In recent years, China has proposed a fivepoint initiative on achieving security and stability in the Middle East, a fourpoint proposal for the political settlement of the Syrian issue, and a threepoint vision for the implementation of the twostate solution to the Palestinian question. China successfully hosted the Saudi ArabiaIran talks in Beijing which produced major outcomes. All the efforts are aimed to encourage regional countries to seek strength through solidarity and resolve disputes and differences through dialogue and consultation. China will continue to work relentlessly to that end with the international community. The international community has been calling more strongly for a ceasefire. The UN General Assembly has adopted two resolutions with an overwhelming majority. We hope the US will listen to the voice of the international community, stop singlehandedly blocking Security Council resolutions, and play its due role to promote an immediate ceasefire and prevent an even larger humanitarian catastrophe.  Bloomberg The US military commander in the IndoPacific has said that China has reduced the number of the socalled dangerous fighter jet intercepts against US aircraft since the summit meeting between President Biden and President Xi Jinping last month. Can you respond to that Wang Wenbin I refer you to competent Chinese authorities for the specifics. Let me say more broadly that China is firmly opposed to the frequent closein reconnaissance conducted by US warships and aircraft around Chinas airspace and waters. We urge the US to stop those dangerous activities which threaten and undermine Chinas security and heighten the risk of regional conflict. CCTV Its reported that on December , the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing the Chinese governments forced assimilation of Tibetan children through boarding schools in Xizang, and called on the European Union and its member states to take actions. Whats Chinas comment? Wang Wenbin We have noted relevant reports. Whats said in the relevant resolution of the European Parliament is disinformation. It smears Chinas image and interferes in Chinas internal affairs. We deplore and strongly oppose this. We urge the European Parliament to stop spreading disinformation, stop using Xizangrelated issues to interfere in Chinas internal affairs and stop all words and deeds that might undermine the mutual trust and cooperation between China and Europe. Xizang now enjoys a booming economy, harmonious and stable society, and effective protection and promotion of cultural heritage. The rights and freedoms of all ethnic groups, including the freedom of religious belief and the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages, are fully protected. The human rights conditions in Xizang are better than ever, as witnessed by the international community. In the case of Xizang, due to highly scattered population, children have to travel long distances to get to school, which is very inconvenient. If schools were to be built in every place the students live, it would be very difficult to ensure adequate teachers and quality of teaching in each school. That is why local governments set up boarding schools according to actual needs to ensure all childrens equal right to education. It is entirely up to the students and their parents whether to go to boarding schools or not. Students can choose to go home on every weekend, holiday and festival, as well as during the winter and summer breaks. Parents can visit their children at school any time and take their children home whenever needed. Besides, relevant schools open courses of traditional culture, such as Tibetan language and literature and folk dance, provided traditional food unique to the Xizang Plateau, and students are allowed to wear traditional dresses at school. The European Parliaments attacks and smears against these boarding schools in Xizang are actually a kind of violation of the childrens right to education, which is damaging to the human rights conditions in Xizang. In recent years, in European countries, we have seen growing violation of the rights of refugees and migrants, growing xenophobia and racism, inadequate attention to economic, social and cultural rights as well as the right to development, and selective application and double standards when it comes to freedom of the press and forced labor. If the European Parliament truly cares about human rights, it should address Europes own issues first and pay attention to human rights violations in places like Gaza, rather than apply double standard and selective negligence, and instrumentalize and weaponize the human rights issue.

The DPRK will continue to enhance coordination with China on multilateral affairs, safeguard the common interests of the two countries and contribute to peace and stability in the region. The two sides also exchanged views on issues of mutual interest. Xinhua News Agency Can you share the arrangement of the th regular meeting between Chinese Premier and Russian Prime Minister? Whats Chinas expectation for the meeting? Wang Wenbin The regular meeting between Chinese Premier and Russian Prime Minister is an important mechanism for delivering on the common understandings between the two presidents and coordinating practical cooperation in various fields. It has been held annually since its launch in . During this years meeting, the two sides will have indepth exchanges of views on bilateral relations, practical cooperation and issues of mutual interest. Under the strategic guidance of President Xi Jinping and President Putin, ChinaRussia relations have enjoyed sound and steady growth. Next year, the two countries will mark the th anniversary of diplomatic ties and open the years of culture between China and Russia. We hope this regular meeting will help deepen cooperation, enhance cultural, peopletopeople and subnational exchange, and further grow the ChinaRussia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era.  CCTV Its reported that the first viceministerial level meeting of the ChinaSaudi ArabiaIran trilateral joint committee was held on December  in Beijing. Could you share more information? Why is it held at this particular time? What is the significance of the meeting? Wang Wenbin The first viceministerial level meeting of the ChinaSaudi ArabiaIran trilateral joint committee was held on December  in Beijing.

The three parties also discussed the trilateral cooperation in various fields and stated their common positions on regional hotspot issues including Palestine. The recent situation in the Middle East is complex and serious. In times like this, it is all the more necessary to resolve disputes and differences through dialogue, consultation and political means. The future of the Middle East must always be in the hands of the people in the region. China will always support the people in the Middle East in independently exploring their development paths. We will always support Middle East countries in uniting and working together to find solutions to the security issues in the region. China will continue to contribute its insights to the peace and tranquility in the Middle East and play our positive role in this process. AFP North Korea today fired its most advanced ballistic missile that has the potential to reach the US. Whats Chinas comment on this? Wang Wenbin China noted the latest development on the Korean Peninsula. The Korean Peninsula issues are complex. The development of the situation fully proves that trying to solve the problem through military deterrence and pressuring will not work, and will only do the opposite and make the issues and tensions worse. Dialogue and consultation is the fundamental way for settling the Peninsula issues. We hope that relevant parties will face up to the crux of the Peninsula issues and take concrete steps to advance their political settlement and safeguard peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. Kyodo News Japan and ASEAN countries held a summit in Tokyo this weekend and issued a joint statement announcing the strengthening of security cooperation. Whats Chinas comment? Wang Wenbin China believes that all cooperation should be conducive to deeper mutual trust between countries in the region and should not target any third party. The situation in the East and South China Seas is generally stable at the moment. We hope relevant countries will earnestly respect regional countries effort to safeguard peace and stability.  China Review News The trial of Jimmy Lai under the Hong Kong national security law opened today. The US and the UK criticized China over the case and the Hong Kong national security law. Whats your comment? Wang Wenbin Hong Kong follows the rule of law. Any law in Hong Kong must be observed and those who break the law must be held accountable. Jimmy Lai is a major mastermind and participant of the antiChina riots in Hong Kong. He is an agent and pawn of the antiChina forces, and the person behind the riots in Hong Kong. What he did was detrimental to Hong Kongs prosperity and stability and the wellbeing of the people in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong law enforcement and judicial authorities have handled and tried the case in accordance with the law. This is fully justified, legitimate and lawful. As for the US and UKs statements, making such irresponsible comments on an ongoing judicial process is against the principle of the rule of law, the international law and the basic norms governing international relations. This is politically motivated and one hundred percent double standard. China firmly rejects this. The Central Government firmly supports the Hong Kong SAR in upholding national security in accordance with the law and bringing criminals who endanger national security to justice. Attempts to smear, disturb and sabotage Hong Kongs national security law will not succeed. Reuters Does China support North Koreas launch of the missiles on Sunday and Monday? This is given North Korea said that the recent arrival of a nuclearpowered US submarine is a preview of a nuclear war. Wang Wenbin I just stated Chinas position on relevant issue. All parties need to face the crux of the Korean Peninsula issues squarely and take concrete steps to advance their political settlement and safeguard peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. The Paper Its reported that the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Saturday that the US State Department has approved a USD  million sale of life cycle support and equipment to Taiwan for its Command, Control, Communications and Computers, or C, capabilities. Whats Chinas comment? Wang Wenbin By announcing another arms sale to Chinas Taiwan region, the UShas blatantly violated the oneChina principle and the stipulations of the three ChinaUS joint communiqus, especially the August  Communiqu.This move seriously undermines Chinas sovereignty and security interests, harms peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and sends a wrong message to separatist forces seeking Taiwan independence. China deplores and strongly opposes this and has made solemn dmarches to the US side. The Taiwan question is entirely Chinas internal affair that brooks no foreign interference. No matter how many weapons the US provides to the Taiwan region, it will neither change the historic course of Chinas reunification, nor weaken the Chinese peoples firm will in safeguarding our national sovereignty and territorial integrity. We urge the US to seriously honor its commitment to oneChina and not supporting Taiwan independence, stop arming Taiwan and causing a dangerous trend, stop creating factors that could heighten tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and stop conniving at and supportingtheseparatists attempt to seek Taiwan independence by force. China will and must be reunited. China will take resolute and strong measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity and take countermeasures against relevant companies involved in arms sales to Taiwan.  Beijing Youth Daily US Secretary of State Blinken issued a statement on Dec  saying that the US rejects Chinas attempt to use cash awards to threaten and harass those advocating freedom and democracy and urges Hong Kong authorities to respect the protected rights and freedoms enumerated in the Basic Law. Does China have any response? Wang Wenbin We firmly oppose US slandering of the National Security Law for Hong Kong and interference in the rule of law of the Hong Kong SAR. Those antiChina rioters who have fled overseas are suspected of endangering national security. Based on facts and in accordance with the law, the Hong Kong SAR issued arrest warrants for these fugitives. This is the right thing to do and is in line with the international law and customary practice. The US own national security legislation also has extraterritorial effect. By bolstering the rioters from Hong Kong, the US has not only trampled the rule of law in Hong Kong but also once again exposed its longstanding double standards on human rights and the rule of law. Hong Kong affairs are purely Chinas internal affairs that brook no external interference. We urge the US to reflect on its own behavior and respect Chinas sovereignty and rule of law in Hong Kong. The US shouldnt be a haven for criminals. China is determined to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests. The attempts to interfere in Hong Kongs affairs and undermine the rule of law in Hong Kong will not succeed. China News Service Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said in an interview on December  that a more assertive China posed a real challenge to its neighbors in Asia the South China Sea situation is the most complex geopolitical challenge that the world faces the Philippines and Japan are having increasing collaboration and should carry out trilateral cooperation with the US. What is Chinas response to this? Wang Wenbin Over the past few months, it has been the Philippines who is breaching the common understandings with China and heightening tensions in the South China Sea it is the Philippines who has attempted to change the current status of Renai Jiao and make it a fait accompli and it is the Philippines who has on every occasion courted external forces to put pressure on China. No matter what smokescreen the Philippines uses and what blame game it plays, nothing will change those facts The Philippines promised to tow away the warship illegally grounded at Renai Jiao  years ago. But  years on, the warship is still there. China and the Philippines had agreed to properly manage the issue of Renai Jiao and thereby kept things stable at sea. However, over the course of this year, the Philippines has gone back on its words and kept sending government and military vessels into the waters of Renai Jiao to supply construction materials for the largescale repair and reinforcement of the grounded warship and permanently occupy Renai Jiao. This is what has caused tensions between China and the Philippines. The Philippines, bolstered by external support, has brushed aside Chinas goodwill and restraint and repeatedly challenged Chinas principles and red line. This is the major risk that could drive up tensions at sea. China remains committed to upholding peace and stability in the South China Sea through dialogue and consultation with the Philippines and other ASEAN countries. That being said, China will not weaken in its resolve to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. We hope the Philippines will realize that tying itself to some major power and forcing China to back down on issues concerning Chinas core interests will lead nowhere. Ultimately, it is the Philippines own interests and the regions peace and stability that will take the toll. "
"âForeign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference onâDecember 15, 2023"," CCTVWe noted that General Secretary and President Xi Jinping successfully concluded his state visit to Viet Nam. Can youfurtherbrief us on the visit anditsimportant outcomes? Mao NingFrom December  to , General Secretary and President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Viet Nam upon invitation. Foreign Minister Wang Yigavea detailedoverview ofthe visit anditsimportant outcomes. As the most important political agenda for ChinaViet Nam relations this year, this successful visit is of great historic significance and marks a new milestone in the relations between the two parties and countries. The Vietnamese side attached great importance to this visit. The warm receptionextendedby Viet Nam wasunprecedentedandof the highest level. The international media closely followedthe visit and widely believe that this visit to Viet Nam is of significance to the region and beyond, and willhave an importantand farreaching impact on the growth of relations between the two parties and countries, as well as on the whole region and even the global landscape. Three highlights of the visit are as follows First, the ChinaViet Nam relations are brought to a new level. The highlight moment of the visit iswhenleaders of the two parties and the two countries made the major historic decision to build a ChinaViet Nam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance. During the visit, General Secretary Xi Jinping and General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Viet Nam CPV Nguyen Phu Trong held long, indepth strategic communication and hearttoheart talks as comrades to share governance experience. Both sides agreed that the two parties and countries should grasp the special strategic significance of ChinaViet Nam relations from the height of strengthening world socialist forces and ensuring the steady advancement of the two countriessocialism causes. The two General Secretaries set the new characterization of the relations between the two parties and two countries, and announcedthe decisionto build a ChinaViet Nam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance on the basis of deepeningtheChinaViet Nam comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. As the most important political outcome of the visit, the new characterization is a continuation and buildup of the yearlong ChinaViet Nam comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. It is a natural resultthat echoesthe trend of the times and serves thefundamentalinterests of the two countries and two peoples. The ChinaViet Nam relationshipis now ina newphasewith new goalsand new impetus. General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and other Vietnamese leaders stated clearly that the Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Global Civilization Initiative and other important global initiatives proposed by President Xi Jinping aim to safeguard humanitys common interest. The Vietnamese side firmly supports and will actively participate in these initiatives. The Vietnamese side emphasized that China is the only country thatcan contribute toallthepriorities of Vietnamese diplomacy and growing relations with China is the top priority and strategic choice made by Viet Nam, which will not be disturbed or sabotaged by any external forces. This sets a solid political foundation for building a ChinaViet Nam community with a shared future. Second, practical cooperation produced new results. General Secretary Xi Jinping and General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong identified sixgoalsfor ChinaViet Nam relations under new circumstances, namely stronger political mutual trust, more substantial security cooperation, deeper practical cooperation, more solidpublicsupportfor bilateral relations, closer coordination and collaboration on multilateral issues and better solutions for managing differences. Concrete steps were also proposed to realize thosegoals. During the visit, the two sides signed more than  cooperation agreements, covering the Belt and Road Initiative, development cooperation, digital economy, green development, transportation, inspection and quarantine, defense and law enforcement cooperation,andmaritime cooperation, etc. During the visit, President Xi Jinping elaborated on the intrinsic requirements and distinctive features of Chinese modernization. He pointed out thatmodernization of the over . billion Chinese people is a huge opportunity for the worldThe remarkable development achievements of China and Viet Nam are a result of an open and inclusive world, especially a peaceful and stable Asia Pacific China and Viet Nam need to step up coordination on multilateral affairs, uphold true multilateralism, safeguard the global free trade system andbuild safe, secure, stable, unimpeded, efficient, open and inclusive global industrial and supply chains that benefit all. These important common understandings added new dimensions to the ChinaViet Nam comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership and will produce a more solid material foundation for the building of a ChinaViet Nam community with a shared future. Third,a new chapter was written for the traditional friendship between China and Viet Nam. General Secretary Xi Jinping noted thatit is important to take a systematic approach to advance peopletopeople friendship between China and Viet NamChinaViet Nam cooperation needs to be weighted toward livelihood areasThe two sides should step up cooperation on youth and at subnational levels.The two General Secretaries and their wives took time out of their tight schedule to jointly meet with over representatives of young Chinese and Vietnamese and people who have contributed to ChinaViet Nam friendship, during which they encouraged the youthsof the two countries tocarry forward ChinaViet Nam friendship, playtheirpart in promoting the development of the Asia Pacific, andbe pioneers in promoting human progress. We believe that under the strategic guidance of the top leaders of the two parties and with the joint support from people of all sectors of the two countries, the traditional friendship between China and Viet Nam will be passed from generation to generation, keep flourishing, and provide a solid public foundation for the building of a community with a shared future that carries strategic significance. General Secretary and President Xi Jinpings state visit to Viet Nam is a great success. It is yet another vivid example of China pursuing neighborhood diplomacy featuring amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness, and another successful practice of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy. China and all IndoChina Peninsula countries have been committed to building a community with a shared future both bilaterally and multilaterally under the LancangMekong Cooperation mechanism. This represents an important and substantive progress in buildinga community with a shared future withourneighbors, and also another important step in building a community with a shared future for mankind. The visit marks a successful ending for this years overseas trips by Chinas head of state which are full of highlights, and promises another year of fruitful diplomacy of China. AFPHong Kong police yesterday issued arrest warrants for five overseasbasedactivistsaccused of national security crimes. US officials expressed strong condemnation. The UK Foreign Secretary called the movea threat to our democracy and fundamental human rights. Whats your comment? Mao Ning We strongly deplore and firmly opposecertaincountries flagrant slandering against the national security law for Hong Kong and interference in the rule of law in the Hong Kong SAR. Thefive antiChina rioters who have fled overseasare suspected of endangering national security. The Hong Kong police issued arrest warrants for these destabilizing elements in accordance with the law. This is a necessary and legitimate act that is in line with the international law and customary practice. National security laws of other countries, including the US and the UK, also have extraterritorial effect. The five destabilizingelementsengage in acts that endanger national security under the pretext of democracy and human rights. The US and the UK by endorsing and supporting these people have exposed their ill intention of destabilizing Hong Kong. I want to stress that Hong Kong is Chinas Hong Kong. Hong Kong affairs are purely Chinas internal affairsthat brook no external interference.China is determined to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests. Relevant countries should respect Chinas sovereignty and the rule of law in Hong Kong and stop interfering in Chinas internal affairs.

No cooperation should target any third party. TASS Russian President Putin also said yesterday that we see attempts by the West to shift NATO activities to Asia and towards Asia, which clearly go beyond the charter goals of this organization. What is the Foreign Ministrys comment? Mao Ning NATOs attempt to make eastward inroads into the AsiaPacific is not consistent with its mandate as a regional defensive organization and will only bring bloc confrontation into Asia and sabotage regional peace and stability.The ChinaRussia relationship rises above the model of military and political alliance in the Cold War era and is fundamentally different from the exclusive groupings and bloc confrontation practiced by NATO.  The following question was raised after the press conference On December  local time, Guyanese President Irfaan Ali and Venezuelan President Nicols Maduro held a meeting in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to exchange views on territorial disputes between the two countries. The two sides reached consensus over avoiding escalated conflict and dispute and using peaceful means to address differences. The two sides agreed to keep the momentum of dialogue on the issue of Essequibo. Whats Chinas comment? Mao Ning I noted the reports. Guyana and Venezuela are both good friends of China. China is glad to see Guyanese President Irfaan Ali and Venezuelan President Nicols Maduro have direct talks on the territorial disputes between the two countries which produced positive progress. We commend the effort made by relevant countries and organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean. China always supports Guyana and Venezuela in properly settling the delimitation of their boundaries through friendly consultation.

Simon Stiell, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, said in his closing speech to the Conference that the agreement signals the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era. What is Chinas comment on the outcomes? What role will China play in implementing the outcomes of the Conference? Mao Ning After two weeks of tough negotiations and one day into overtime, the UN COP in Dubai was concluded on December . The Conference finished the firstever Global Stocktake since the Paris Agreement took effect, reviewed the past progress and gaps, and charted the course for the further implementation of the Paris Agreement. In particular, this milestone Conference has consolidated the trend of global green and low carbon transition. The success of the Conference reflects the strong consensus of all parties on the urgency of addressing climate change issues. Its outcomes sent out a message of multilateralism and tackling climate change with greater solidarity and stronger action. COP reaffirmed the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The Conference adopted on its first day the decision on the Loss and Damage Fund which developing countries cared deeply about. The Conference also adopted other major decisions including the Global Goal on Adaptation GGA Framework, the Just Transition Work Program, among others. That being said, no substantial progress has been made in fulfilling the pledges made by developed countries of taking the lead in reducing emissions, and providing support of capital, technology and capacity building to developing countries. The issue of unilateral measures hindering international cooperation has not yet been properly resolved. To build a global climate governance system that is fair, reasonable, cooperative and winwin remains an uphill task. China attaches high importance to COP. President Xi Jinpings Special Representative, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Ding Xuexiang attended the World Climate Action Summit and the G plus China Summit on climate change and delivered remarks. During COP, China fully participated in consultations on all topics and coordinated closely with the UAE, the chair of COP, and other parties to firmly uphold the common interest of developing countries. China also provided solutions for negotiations on key issues, engaged parties to seek common ground while resolving differences and made important contribution to shaping positive outcomes. Going forward, China will stay committed to the path of Chinese modernization featuring harmony between man and nature, continue to actively advance international cooperation on addressing climate change and work with all parties to promote the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and together build a clean, beautiful world. Reuters Several senior staff at a German auditor distance themselves from audit conducted by that firm of a Volkswagen joint venture plant in Xinjiang. They found no evidence of forced labor there. The firm later said that besides a small number of staff, no other employees participated in, supported or backed this project. Whats Chinas response? Mao Ning The socalled forced labor in Xinjiang is a lie that has been debunked by facts and truth.  Hubei Media Group US National Security Council member Joshua Geltzer said that Section  of the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA, an important legal basis for US intelligence authorities to eavesdrop on nonUS citizens overseas and step up international surveillance without authorization, will expire on December . It was estimated that nearly  percent of President Bidens daily intelligence brief came from these big ears. What is Chinas comment? Mao Ning The US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA, adopted after Watergate, was originally aimed at preventing government authorities from abusing power and carrying out arbitrary eavesdropping. However, Section , added in , permit the National Security Agency to carry out eavesdropping and surveillance without obtaining an individualized court order. After that, the US government has been expanding the scope of eavesdropping and surveillance to interfere in other countries internal affairs and meddle in the normal course of international affairs. This runs counter to international law and basic norms governing international relations. The more targets the US spies on, the fewer friends it has. The US needs a better sense of boundary and less obsession for control. China Review News It is reported that the launching ceremony of the East Coast Rail Link ECRL which is being built by a Chinese company was held in Kuantan, capital of Pahang. The Head of State of Malaysia Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah officially launched the track laying for the project at the ceremony. What is your comment? Mao Ning The East Coast Rail Link is a landmark of the Belt and Road cooperation between China and Malaysia. It is also one of the largest single transportation infrastructure projects built overseas by Chinese companies. The project now is making smooth progress, with over half being completed. When fully completed, the railway will be the first of its kind that links the east and west coasts of Malaysia, and improve connectivity along the railway. This year marks the th anniversary of both the BRI and the establishment of ChinaMalaysia comprehensive strategic partnership. This March, President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim reached important common understandings on jointly building a ChinaMalaysia community with a shared future, opening a new chapter in ChinaMalaysia relations. The bilateral Belt and Road cooperation has borne fruitful results, including MalaysiaChina Kuantan Industrial Park and Kuantan Port, which, along with Port Klang, are to be connected by the ECRL. Next year will see the th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral ties. We hope that the two sides can further deepen bilateral practical cooperation in various fields and bring more benefits to the two peoples. AFP According to its officials, the Philippines deported  Chinese nationals today, saying they did not have work permits and had been engaging in online scams. Could China provide more information? Mao Ning The Chinese government always asks Chinese nationals overseas to observe local laws and regulations. We also hope the Philippines can take earnest measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese nationals. Reuters South Koreas military said it scrambled fighter jets when two Chinese and four Russian military planes entered its air defence zone today. Whats Chinas comment? Mao Ning It is learned that the Chinese military aircraft were carrying out routine and conventional flight activities in international air space. This is in compliance with international law.  The following question was raised after the press conference Its reported that Myanmar military spokesperson said Myanmars government, facilitated by China, held talks with the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Taang National Liberation Army and the Arakan Army. Can you confirm this and whats Chinas comment? Mao Ning China supports the peace process of the northern Myanmar and has provided support and facilitation for dialogue and contact between relevant parties in Myanmar. Since fighting broke out on October  in northern Myanmar, China has been making relentless efforts to promote talks to end the fighting and deescalate the situation. With Chinas mediation effort, Myanmars military recently held peace talks with the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Taang National Liberation Army and the Arakan Army in China and reached agreement on a number of arrangements, including the temporary ceasefire and maintaining the momentum of dialogue. The conflict in northern Myanmar has been notably deescalating, which not only serves the interest of relevant parties in Myanmar but also helps ensure peace and tranquility at the ChinaMyanmar border area. China hopes that relevant parties in Myanmar can speed up efforts to implement what has been agreed, exercise maximum restraint, actively ease the situation on the ground, promptly manage sporadic confrontation events and together realize the soft landing of the situation in northern Myanmar."
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on December 13, 2023"," At the invitation of the President of the Republic of Madagascar Andry Nirina Rajoelina, President Xi Jinpings Special Envoy and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference Hu Chunhua will attend the inauguration of President Rajoelina in Madagascars capital Antananarivo on December . CCTV General Secretary and President Xi Jinping started his state visit to Viet Nam yesterday. The leaders of the two countries jointly announced a new characterization of the relationship for the two parties and two countries. Can you share more information with us? Mao Ning General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President Xi Jinping is in Viet Nam for a state visit. General Secretary Xi Jinping and General Secretary of the Communist Party of Viet Nam Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong held talks and jointly witnessed the signing of cooperation documents between the two sides. President Xi Jinping also met or held talks with Viet Nams State President Vo Van Thuong, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Chairman of the National Assembly Vuong Dinh Hue. General Secretary Xi Jinping and General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong jointly announced a new characterization of the relationship for the two parties and two countries, working together for a ChinaViet Nam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance on the basis of deepening the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. The two General Secretaries agree that China and Viet Nam, as close and friendly neighbors, share the same aspiration and philosophy. As good neighbors, good partners, good brothers, and good comrades, China and Viet Nam have unique advantages of following the trend of the times, geographic proximity and shared cultural affinity in building a community with a shared future that carries strategic significance. The two sides should carry forward the traditional friendship forged by oldergeneration leaders, build a community with a shared future together, and make steady progress in their modernization drives, so as to achieve winwin outcomes and common success, benefit the two peoples, and contribute to regional peace and prosperity. China and Viet Nam are both socialist countries and neighbors with timehonored friendship. In , the two countries established the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. The new characterization of ChinaViet Nam relationship is a continuation, buildup and upgrading of the  years of comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. It is a natural result in line with the trend of the times, serves the common interests of the two parties, two countries and two peoples, and meets the strategic need of revitalizing the worlds socialist cause. We believe that with concerted efforts of both sides, the ChinaViet Nam relations will enter a new stage that enjoys deeper political mutual trust, more substantive security cooperation, deeper mutually beneficial cooperation, a more solid public foundation, closer coordination on multilateral affairs, better management of differences, and joint efforts for new achievements in the socialist development of the two countries. China News Service UK Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs David Cameron reportedly met with Sebastien Lai, the son of Jimmy Lai, on the night of December  local time. The UK side said it opposes the Hong Kong National Security Law and will continue to stand by Jimmy Lai and the people of Hong Kong. During a recent visit to the US, David Cameron also said that the world has changed a lot, China has become much more aggressive, and they must offer other countries an alternative to China rather than leave them to the mercy of Chinese debt traps and better protect themselves from Chinas cyber attacks and other hostile acts. Whats Chinas comment? Mao Ning Its public knowledge that Jimmy Lai is one of the most notorious antiChina elements bent on destabilizing Hong Kong and a mastermind of the riots that took place in Hong Kong. He blatantly colluded with external forces to undermine Chinas national security and is responsible for numerous egregious acts. The Hong Kong SAR took action to hold him accountable in accordance with the law. This is beyond reproach. The UK apparently considers itself a country based on the rule of law, but it is now openly interfering in an ongoing judicial process. The UK has recently adopted its own National Security Bill, but it is now brazenly opposing Chinas national security legislation for Hong Kong. That says everything about the UKs hypocrisy and hidden agenda. More than three years on since the Hong Kong National Security Law was adopted, more than  percent of people in Hong Kong believe the law has made Hong Kong safer. What the UK has done is laughably pointless, especially when Hong Kong has already restored order and is set to thrive. We ask the UK to respect facts and the rule of law and stop meddling in Hong Kongs affairs, which are Chinas internal affairs. By calling China aggressive, the UK is misrepresenting facts. China follows an independent foreign policy of peace. We are a partner presenting opportunities to other countries, not a threat posing challenges. We are committed to developing relations with other countries on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit. At the same time, we will resolutely defend our sovereignty, security and development interests. The UKs debt trap rhetoric is not based on facts. Chinas investment and financing cooperation with fellow developing countries is carried out in compliance with international rules, market laws and the principle of debt sustainability and has been widely welcomed. In fact, not a single cooperation partner has accused China of creating debt traps. It is a handful of Western countries who have been spreading the fallacy of Chinese debt traps. The multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors these countries dominate are the major creditors of developing countries and constitute the major source of stress for them in terms of debt repayment. They are the ones that need to make substantive contributions to easing developing countries debt burden. Cybersecurity is a global challenge. China firmly cracks down on cyber attacks and holds that cybersecurity needs to be jointly safeguarded by all countries through dialogue and cooperation. We oppose politicizing cybersecurity issues and smearing other countries without any factual basis. We call on the UK to reject the Cold War mentality, stop spreading China threat narratives, look at China and ChinaUK relations in an objective and rational light, and work with China for the sound and steady development of bilateral ties. Reuters According to reports in Argentinean media, Argentina has sent China a letter about the currency swap arrangement between Peoples Bank of China and Argentinean central bank. These reports say that China asked Argentina to clear up its stance towards China after Argentinean President Milei made antiChina remarks on his campaign trail. Could you confirm whether this is the case? Mao Ning On the currency swap arrangement between China and Argentina, Id refer you to competent Chinese authorities. On the relations between China and Argentina, we have previously stated our position. China and Argentina are both major developing countries and important emerging economies. The two countries are comprehensive strategic partners and our bilateral relations are in good shape. China values the growth of its relations with Argentina from a strategic and longterm perspective. We stand ready to work with the new government of Argentina for the sustained and steady development of the ChinaArgentina comprehensive strategic partnership.  AFP A select committee of the US House of Representatives issued a report yesterday calling for a reset on the USChina economic relationship. What is Chinas response? Mao Ning The committee you mentioned is obsessed with attacking and smearing China. It is biased and hostile and has no rationality to speak of. What they have said fully shows that some in the US are attempting to politicize and weaponize trade and tech issues between China and the US. We firmly oppose this. ChinaUS economic and trade cooperation benefits both sides. There is no winner in a trade war or tariff war. Curbs and protectionism will only disrupt normal trade and destabilize industrial and supply chains. They do not serve the interests of any party. The US needs to earnestly respect the principles of market economy and international trade rules, and create a favorable environment for ChinaUS economic and trade cooperation, rather than do the opposite. CRI On December  local time, US State Department released a statement making groundless accusation against Chinas law enforcement measures in waters near Huangyan Dao and Renai Jiao and threatening once again that the US Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty extends to the South China Sea. Whats Chinas comment? Mao Ning Ive elaborated on the facts and Chinas position concerning the recent incidents in waters of Chinas Renai Jiao and Ill not go over it again. But what needs to be pointed out is that Huangyan Dao hasalwaysbeen part of Chinas territory and China has indisputable sovereignty over Huangyan Dao and its adjacent waters. On December , three official vessels of the Philippines, without permission from the Chinese side, intruded into adjacent waters ofHuangyan Dao. China Coast Guard took necessary measures in accordance with the law, which were professional, restrained, lawful and legitimate. The US State Department, in disregard of the facts, issued a statement to groundlessly attack Chinas fully justified law enforcement activities to safeguard our rights at Renai Jiao and Huangyan Dao. The statement is an attempt to endorse the Philippines infringement of Chinese sovereignty and provocation. We firmly reject it. For some time, out of selfish geopolitical interests, the US has incited, supported and assisted in the Philippines infringement and provocation at sea, and repeatedly made threats by citing the US Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty. Such moves blatantly embolden the Philippines violation of Chinas sovereignty, seriously violate the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and gravely jeopardize regional peace and stability. China has made clear that the socalled arbitral award on the South China Sea is illegal, null and void, and has no binding effect whatsoever. The US itself would not implement the judgement of the International Court of Justice and international arbitral awards. In what position is the US to tell China that it should implement an illegal arbitral award? The US needs to know that no threat, coercion or unfounded attack and accusation will lead anywhere or shake Chinas firm resolve and will in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. China will continue to resolutely uphold its legitimate sovereignty and rights and interests in accordance with domestic and international law. The USs attempts will not succeed. Antara The UN General Assembly has adopted a resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, but it is an unbinding resolution. How can China as a member state of Security Council use this resolution as the next step in the Security Council? Mao Ning At the request of Arab and Islamic countries, the UN General Assembly held an emergency special session on the Palestinian question on December , which adopted a resolution tabled by Arab countries requesting an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, compliance with the obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law, notably with regard to the protection of civilians, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages as well as ensuring humanitarian access. This is the second time that the UNGA emergency special session voted overwhelmingly for a resolution on the current PalestinianIsraeli conflict, which reflects the strong international call for a ceasefire and what the world wants between war and peace.China fully supports the resolution. We cosponsored and voted for it. We hope to see the full implementation of this resolution, ceasefire and end of hostilities as soon as possible, alleviation of the humanitarian crisis and restoration of peace and stability in the region. China stands ready to continue working with all parties to play a positive and constructive role in realizing lasting peace between Palestine and Israel through the twostate solution.  China Review News According to reports, TEPCO made an announcement on December , confirming that a worker decommissioning the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plants No. reactor was contaminated with radioactive substances and radioactive materials may have been incorporated into the body due to exposure to internal radiation. What is Chinas comment? Mao Ning I noted the reports. During the decommissioning of Japans Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and the handling of the nuclearcontaminated water, accidents have happened one after another involving workers being sprayed with nuclearcontaminated water or exposed to radioactive substances. This speaks to the seriousness of the problem and once again proves the vital importance of properly handling the nuclearcontaminated water. Japans discharge of the nuclearcontaminated water into the ocean is scheduled to last  years or even longer, and this poses enormous risks. China urges Japan to take seriously the concerns of stakeholders, fully cooperate in establishing an international monitoring arrangement that has the substantive participation of relevant parties and will remain effective over the long haul, and take concrete actions to avoid the longterm harm of the discharge to marine environment and peoples health. The Paper We noted that the Supreme Court of India, at the request of some in India, made a verdict, upholding the validity of the order abrogating Article  of Constitution, asking the Indian government to restore the statehood in Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir at the earliest, and upholding the validity of the decision of the Indian government in  to carve out the socalled union territory of Ladakh. What is Chinas comment? Mao Ning China has never recognized the socalled union territory of Ladakh set up unilaterally and illegally by India. Indias domestic judicial verdict does not change the fact that the western section of the ChinaIndia border has always belonged to China. AFP The COP Presidency released a proposed text of a final climate deal today. Can you share Chinas position on the text as well as this years COP? Mao Ning We noted the progress of COP negotiations. COP is a very important conference. China has taken an active part in the discussion and negotiation on the agenda items and supports the host country the UAE in making the conference a success. We hope the outcomes of this meeting will contribute to the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and lend more support to developing countries efforts to realize energy transition and better cope with climate change. Bloomberg The US has sanctioned more than  companies and individuals in China, Trkiye and the UAE over alleged support for Russia in its war efforts. Would the Foreign Ministry like to comment on this? Mao Ning China opposes the USs unilateral sanctions and longarm jurisdiction. The US needs to correct its wrong practice and stop containing and going after Chinese companies. China will do what is necessary to firmly safeguard Chinese companies lawful rights and interests. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on December 12, 2023"," CCTV On December , Argentinas new President Javier Milei met with President Xi Jinpings Special Envoy and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress Wu Weihua. Could you share more details on that meeting? Mao Ning At the invitation of the government of Argentina, President Xi Jinpings Special Envoy and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress Wu Weihua attended the inauguration of President of Argentina Javier Milei in Argentinas capital Buenos Aires. On December , President Javier Milei met with Wu Weihua. Wu Weihua extended President Xi Jinpings warm congratulations and best wishes to President Javier Milei. President Javier Milei thanked President Xi for sending the special envoy to attend his inauguration, and asked Vice Chairman Wu to extend his sincere greetings and best wishes to President Xi. He stressed that the new government of Argentina attaches high importance to its relations with China and will continue to firmly follow the oneChina principle and the Argentine side stands ready to further promote the indepth exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in various fields including economy and trade and cultural and peopletopeople exchanges. Global Times It is reported that IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath said on December  that around , trade restricting measures were imposed last year, nearly three times the number imposed in . If the global economy fragments into two blocs, including predominantly the US and Europe in the Western bloc and China and Russia in the Eastern bloc, the global losses are estimated to be about . to  percent of global GDP. What is your comment? Mao Ning Trade protectionism is not conducive to the free flow of factors including goods, services and capital, distorts resource allocation, and undermines consumers interests. It does no good to the production efficiency and the recovery and development of the world economy. What is concerning is that some countries have been pushing for decoupling and severing of supply chains under the pretext of security, and imposing trade restriction measures in the name of derisking. This will only make the world even less safe and bring more risks. As President Xi Jinping stressed, in an increasingly interdependent and integrated world where countries form a community of shared interests, openness, inclusiveness and winwin cooperation are the only viable option. China is always committed to building an open world economy and steadfastly promoting highlevel openingup. We always believe that absence of cooperation is the biggest risk and failure to develop is the biggest security threat. China stands ready to work with all parties to realize common development and prosperity through equal consultation and mutually beneficial cooperation. Associated Press of Pakistan On December , Indian Supreme Court announced a decision endorsing the Indian governments unilateral step to change the status of Jammu and Kashmir region, which is a clear violation of UNSC Resolution  which decided that the final settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir issue can only take place by UNsupervised plebiscite. What is Chinas response? Mao Ning Chinas position on the Kashmir issue is consistent and clearcut. The Kashmir issue, left from the past, needs to be resolved peacefully and appropriately in accordance with the UN Charter, Security Council resolutions and relevant bilateral agreement. Parties concerned need to settle the dispute through dialogue and consultation so as to maintain regional peace and stability.  Bloomberg Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the US will take the strongest possible action to protect national security when asked about how the Commerce Department will respond to Huaweis chipmaking breakthroughs. Do you have any response to her comments? Mao Ning We have made clear our position on US chip export controls targeting China on multiple occasions. Such abuse of export control measures seriously harms Chinese companies legitimate rights and interests, destabilizes global chip industrial and supply chains, violates the principles of market economy and fair competition, and serves no ones interests. We firmly reject this. The US needs to act on its commitments of not seeking a decoupling from China and not seeking to halt Chinas economic development. We will be watching closely relevant developments and resolutely defend our legitimate rights and interests. Bloomberg One more on Raimondo on a separate issue. She said the US is looking into specifics of three new AI accelerators that Nvidia is developing for China. Earlier this month she vowed to restrict any new chips that give the Asian country AI capabilities. Can you give any response to that? Mao Ning We firmly oppose the USs abuse of export controls and malicious attempts to blockade and keep down China. AFP Chinas official media reported today that President Xi is now in Hanoi on a state visit to Viet Nam. Could you update us on this? Mao Ning General Secretary and President Xi Jinping is paying a state visit to Viet Nam starting from today. More information on the visit will be released in a timely manner. Please check back for updates. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on December 11, 2023"," CCTV On December , the Philippines sent vessels to intrude into waters of Renai Jiao in Chinas Nansha Qundao in an attempt to send construction materials to the illegally grounded warship there. The mission was blocked by China Coast Guard. Afterwards, the Philippine President and the Philippine National Security Council blamed China. Do you have any comment? Mao Ning On December , one cargo vessel, one official vessel and two coast guard ships of the Philippines, without permission from the Chinese government, intruded into adjacent waters ofRenai Jiao in Chinas Nansha Qundao in an attempt to send construction materials to the illegally grounded warship at the reef. In disregard of the warnings of the China Coast Guard CCG vessels, a Philippine vessel went headlong towards Renai Jiaos lagoon and dangerously rammed a CCG ship on the scene. Thisgravely violated Chinas sovereignty and jeopardized the safety of the Chinese ships and personnel. The CCG took necessary enforcement measures against the Philippine ship in accordance with domestic and international law, which were professional, restrained, justified and legitimate. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has lodged serious dmarche in strong protest to the Philippine side. I need to stress that Renai Jiao is part of Chinas Nansha Qundao. China has indisputable sovereignty over Nansha Qundao, including Renai Jiao, and their adjacent waters. This was established in the long course of history and is consistent with international law including the UN Charter. It is against the principles of international law and legally untenable for the Philippines to cite the award of the South China Sea arbitration, which is illegal, null and void, to claim that Renai Jiao falls within its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf and deny Chinas sovereignty over it. The responsibility for the recent emergencies in waters of Renai Jiao lies completely with the Philippines. The root cause is that the Philippines has broken its promise and refused to tow away the illegally grounded warship at the reef and attempted to reinforce it on a large scale in an attempt to permanently occupy Renai Jiao. China firmly opposes the Philippines attempt to occupy Renai Jiao and has made clear its solemn position to the Philippine side at various levels and through multiple channels, demanding that the Philippines will not send construction materials to the illegally grounded warship for largescale repair and reinforcement and putting forward proposals for properly managing the situation. However, the Philippine side, in disregard of Chinas goodwill, good faith and restraint, broke its promise and kept stirring up trouble by infringing on Chinas sovereignty and making provocative moves in waters of Renai Jiao. It has also been spreading disinformation to hype up the incidents. This gravely violates international law and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea DOC and seriously infringes on Chinas territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. We once again urge the Philippines to stop infringing on Chinas sovereignty and making provocative moves, stop groundlessly attacking and smearing China, and avoid undermining peace and stability in the South China Sea. We will continue to do what is necessary in accordance with domestic and international laws to resolutely respond to provocative moves that infringe on Chinas sovereignty and defend our territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. NHK Hong Kong held its first district council election guided by the principle of patriots administering Hong Kong on Sunday. Whats your comment? Mao Ning The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council has already made remarks on the Council Ordinary Election of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region HKSAR, which you may refer to. The election was the first of its kind since the restructuring of the district council system in Hong Kong. The election was wellorganized, orderly, fair and just, which demonstrates a new prospect of good governance under the principle of patriots administering Hong Kong. We are fully confident that the new district councils will perform their duties in accordance with the law and believe that the newly elected district council members will serve as a bridge between the HKSAR Government and the Hong Kong people and help the former improve the system of communitylevel governance and improve its effectiveness.  CCTV Yesterday marks the Human Rights Day. Can you introduce Chinas achievements on protecting and promoting human rights? We also noted that a handful of Western countries have been attacking China under the pretext of human rights. Whats Chinas comment? Mao Ning On December , , the UN General Assembly UNGA adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a significant document in the history of human civilization. In , the UNGA designated December  as Human Rights Day. To commemorate the th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, China held an International Symposium in Beijing. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the symposium and delivered a keynote speech, in which he elaborated on the important views of President Xi Jinping on human rights, Chinas human rights development path, and Chinas position and propositions on global human rights governance. The Beijing Declaration was issued at the symposium and received warm response. China holds a peoplecentered human rights philosophy and believes that a happy life for the people is the most important human right. We have built a moderately prosperous society in all respects, won the largest battle against poverty in human history and put in place the worlds largest education, social security, and healthcare systems. We have been working to improve the living environment for our people, develop the wholeprocess peoples democracy, advance the rule of law for human rights and safeguard social equity and justice. China has found a path towards better human rights that follows the trend of the times and fits our national realities and made historic progress in our human rights cause. Promoting and protecting human rights is the common cause of mankind. No country in the world is in the position to act as a preacher on human rights. The most authoritative comment on a countrys human rights conditions comes from its people. Countries right to independently choosing human rights development paths needs to be respected. Certain countries, while ignoring their own serious human rights issues, have been interfering in other countries internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. Such attempts reveal their double standards and hypocrisy. China will stay committed to advancing and protecting human rights, upholding the common values of humanity and engaging in human rights dialogue and cooperation based on equality and mutual respect. China will continue to work with all sides to protect human rights through security, support human rights through development and advance human rights through cooperation in a joint effort to promote the global human rights cause. Reuters The Philippines on Monday has called actions of Chinese vessels against their boats in the South China Sea over the weekend a serious escalation. The Philippines has also this morning said that they are undeterred in protecting their sovereignty. Have the incidents between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea damaged bilateral ties and would diplomacy be of any use in improving the situation? Mao Ning I have shared the facts and truth about what has happened. I would like to stress that the responsibility for the recent emergencies in waters of Renai Jiao lies with the Philippines. The root cause is that the Philippines has broken its promise and refused to tow away the illegally grounded warship at the reef and tried to reinforce it in an attempt to permanently occupy Renai Jiao. In light of the Philippines repeated provocations and infringement at Renai Jiao and its waters, China has been committed to enhancing communication with the Philippines with sincerity and good will to properly handle the situation. We have also put forward proposals on managing and controlling the situation at Renai Jiao. The ball is now with the Philippine side. We hope the Philippines will face up to the root cause of the issue, stop making provocations and creating trouble, and safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea. China News Service It was reported that the UN Security Council on December  voted on a resolution drafted by the UAE calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, but it was not adopted due to US veto. What is your comment? Mao Ning Over the past two months since the outbreak of this round of PalestinianIsraeli conflict, Gaza has seen close to , civilians die from the fights and over one million people displaced. Ceasefire and end of hostilities is currently the top priority and reflects extensive international aspiration. Close to  countries, including China, cosponsored the draft resolution tabled by the UAE representing Arab countries. We regret and are disappointed at the US vetothe only veto on the Security Council draft resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. Connivance at the conflict means heavier civilian casualties and worse humanitarian catastrophe, and will sow more seeds of hatred. On issues of war and peace, life and death, major countries with influence need to play a constructive role in helping end the fight, make utmost efforts to avoid civilian casualties, and stand on the side of peace and the side of life.  Dragon TV According to reports, the EU Delegation in China issued a statement on December , reiterating concern over Chinas severe human rights situation and urging China to respect, protect and fulfil human rights for all, including Uyghurs, Tibetans and persons belonging to ethnic minorities across China. It also mentions the death penalty and prodemocracy activists. Whats Chinas comment? Mao Ning The EU statement contains groundless accusation on Chinas human rights conditions, spreads disinformation, tarnishes Chinas image and gravely violates Chinas internal affairs. China deplores and firmly opposes this and has made solemn dmarches to the EU. China holds a peoplecentered approach and has scored historic achievements in protecting human rights. Xinjiang and Xizang have long enjoyed booming economy, harmonious and stable society, and effective protection and promotion of cultural heritage. The rights and freedoms of all ethnic groups, including the freedom of religious belief and the freedom to use and develop their ethnic groups spoken and written languages, are fully protected. Facts have long disproved the socalled genocide and forced labor as egregious lies. The human rights conditions there are at their historical best, as recognized by the international community. While pointing fingers at developing countries human rights conditions over the years, the EU is in fact experiencing worrying human rights conditions in itself. Recent years have seen in European countries infringement of the rights of refugees and migrants, rising exclusivism and racism, negligence over economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development, and selective application and double standards on issues such as freedom of press and forced labor. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights pointed out that some EU countries are backsliding on fundamental human rights commitments. China strongly urges the EU to recognize Chinas progress in the human rights cause, put down arrogance and bias, abandon the hypocritical double standards, take concrete action to improve its own human rights conditions, stop using human rights as a pretext to interfere in Chinas internal affairs and judicial sovereignty, and stop politicizing, instrumentalizing and weaponizing human rights issues. China Daily On December , the US Department of State issued a human rights report related to Xinjiang, saying that the Chinese authorities have committed genocide and crimes against humanity against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang and announcing sanctions on two Chinese officials. On the same day, the US Department of the Treasury added them to the Specially Designated Nationals List. The US Department of Homeland Security has also added three Chinese companies to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act UFLPA Entity list under domestic law. Do you have any comment on this? Mao Ning The US has made up and spread the false narrative on Xinjiang and imposed illegal sanctions on Chinese companies and officials citing the socalled human rights issues in Xinjiang. This has seriously undermined the interests of relevant Chinese companies and individuals, seriously interfered in Chinas internal affairs and seriously breached the basic norms governing international relations. We are firmly against and strongly condemn that. What Xinjiang has achieved in its development is there for all to see and Chinas Xinjiang policy is widely supported by the people. The US has no right and is in no position to point fingers at the human rights situation in Xinjiang. The socalled genocide and forced labor are nothing but the biggest lie of the century spread by the US with the aim to contain and suppress China and has long been exposed in front of facts and truths. The US, under its own domestic law, has included Chinese entities and personnel into its sanction list in an attempt to disrupt Xinjiangs prosperity and stability and hold back Chinas development, which fully lays bare its malicious intention of using issues related to Xinjiang to contain China. The US is fraught with domestic human rights issues and it has a quite notorious international human rights record. If the US truly cared about human rights, it needs to earnestly address its domestic problems such as racial discrimination, gun violence and drug abuse. The last thing it should do is to veto the Security Council resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire, the only country that has done so, while the humanitarian disaster in Gaza deteriorates by the hour. We urge the US to stop smearing China, cancel the illegal unilateral sanctions on Chinese personnel and companies, and stop implementing wrongful acts such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. China will take resolute counter measures to protect the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese citizens and companies. AFP The foreign ministry of the Philippines summoned the Chinese Ambassador over the recent collision in the South China Sea to lodge a protest with China. Whats your response? Mao Ning The responsibility of the incident completely lies with the Philippines. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China has lodged dmarches in strong protest to the Philippine side. Antara On Gaza, whats the next step that China will take after the US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza? Mao Ning As the humanitarian crisis in Gaza drags on, the top priority is to realize a ceasefire. Though the Security Council resolution draft has been vetoed, the international community should not stop promoting ceasefire, protecting civilians, and easing the humanitarian crisis and the UN Security Council should not stop upholding justice and shouldering its responsibilities. China stands ready to work with the international community to pool all efforts on the common goal of ceasing hostilities in Gaza and work relentlessly to realize the goal.  Reuters Viet Nam media has reported citing the Chinese ambassador to Viet Nam that China is ready to offer grants to Viet Nam to upgrade a railway link from Guangxi to Hanoi and also to speed up plans to develop other railway systems connecting both China and Viet Nam. Are there more details on this development? And whether this topic is going to be a top discussion when President Xi Jinping visits Viet Nam this week? Mao Ning China and Viet Nam enjoy a longstanding friendship and deepening practical cooperation. China is Viet Nams largest trading partner, and Viet Nam is Chinas largest trading partner in ASEAN and the fourth largest trading partner in the world. In the field of connectivity, China and Viet Nam have carried out a lot of practical cooperation, such as the Hanoi light rail Line  constructed by Chinese enterprises, which is the first urban light rail project in Viet Nam and has made travel more convenient for Hanoi citizens. Cooperation between China and Viet Nam has brought tangible benefits to the two peoples. Both countries are willing to further expand bilateral cooperation. During General Secretary and President Xis upcoming visit to Viet Nam this time, the leaders will exchange views on deepening bilateral cooperation. Please stay tuned and check back for more information on this visit later. AFP Also on the Philippines, the US has called for Beijing to halt what it called its dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea. Whats Chinas response? Mao Ning Id like to stress that maritime disputes between China and the Philippines are issues between China and the Philippines. Any third party is not in the position of interfering in the issues. On the one hand, the US, out of selfish geopolitical calculations, has for some time been conniving at, emboldening and supporting the Philippines infringement and provocation in the South China Sea. Yet on the other, the US has been fanning disputes, misrepresenting facts, stoking confrontation and undermining regional peace and stability. China will continue to take necessary steps in accordance with domestic and international laws to firmly safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. Macau Monthly In a recent interview, Viet Nams ambassador to China Pham Sao Mai said that General Secretary and President Xi Jinping will elevate Chinas comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership with Viet Nam to a new level. Do you have any comment? Mao Ning China and Viet Nam are both socialist countries on a path of reform and transformation in keeping with our respective national realities. Strengthening solidarity and friendship and deepening mutuallybeneficial cooperation serves the shared interests of both sides and contributes to peace, stability and prosperity of the region and beyond. China and Viet Nam both attach high importance to the upcoming state visit by General Secretary and President Xi Jinping. A shared path and a shared future is the hallmark of ChinaViet Nam relations. An elevated bilateral relationship is a natural result in accordance with the overwhelming trend. Standing at a new historical point, the two sides will be guided by the highlevel common understandings, carry forward our traditional friendship, hold dear our shared cause and mission, and make new progress in growing our comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. AFP I got a question on the Belt and Road Initiative and the country of Papua New Guinea. Its Prime Minister James Marape has promised to tread carefully with Belt and Road funding from China. He told AFP on Monday that he will not be reckless with foreign loans. Do you have any reaction to these comments? Mao Ning Papua New Guinea is the first Pacific Island country to sign an MOU on Belt and Road cooperation and Belt and Road cooperation plans with China. It has played a leading role and set an example in the Belt and Road cooperation between China and Pacific Island countries. China stands ready to continue working with Papua New Guinea to synergize the development strategies, expand practical cooperation in various fields under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative on the basis of mutual respect and equalfooted consultation, and pursue common development.

Does the foreign ministry have any comment on that as well? Wang Wenbin First of all, I would like to correct you that Taiwan is part of China. There is no socalled defense ministry or foreign ministry of Taiwan. On your first question, I am not aware of the situation and this is not a question on foreign affairs. On your second question, let me say that the normal, friendly relations between China and Latin American countries are deepening and our mutually beneficial cooperation is making positive progress. No matter what the DPP authorities say or do, they cannot change such a sound momentum of growth.  China Daily The eighth LancangMekong Cooperation Foreign Ministers Meeting was held in Beijing yesterday. Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Myanmars Deputy Prime Minister and Union Minister for Foreign Affairs U Than Swe cochaired the meeting. Can you brief us on the outcomes of the meeting? Wang Wenbin The eighth LancangMekong Cooperation LMC Foreign Ministers Meeting was successfully held in Beijing yesterday. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Myanmars Deputy Prime Minister and Union Minister for Foreign Affairs U Than Swe cochaired the meeting. Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sok Chenda Sophea, Thailands Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Parnpree BahiddhaNukara, Vietnamese Minister of Foreign Affairs Bui Thanh Son and Laos Chairman of the Committee for External Relations of the Party Central Committee Thongsavanh Phomvihane attended the meeting. Under the theme of Jointly Strive for Modernization and Cultivate New Strength in Subregional Development, the meeting took stock of the progress of LMC, planned for the priority work in the next stage, and made preparation and built up consensus for the fourth LancangMekong Cooperation Leaders Meeting. Foreign Minister Wang Yi noted, since the seventh LMC Foreign Ministers Meeting, relevant parties have acted in the LancangMekong spirit of development first, equal consultation, practicality and high efficiency, and openness and inclusiveness, taken steady steps to advance cooperation in various areas, achieved a number of new outcomes and created multiple new highlights. First, cooperation has been upgraded under highlevel guidance. Second, economic and trade exchanges have been fully accelerated. Third, peoples wellbeing has continued to improve. Fourth, the bond of the people in LancangMekong countries has been closer. As the first new subregional cooperation mechanism jointly initiated and launched by the six LancangMekong countries, LMC has become a new, important platform for advancing mutually beneficial cooperation in the region. China suggested six priority areas for advancing LMC. First, build a closer community with a shared future. LancangMekong countries need to enhance highlevel exchanges to provide strategic guidance for LMC we need to synergize development strategies to develop the big LancangMekong market and we need to put the people at the center of our work and bring the benefit of cooperation to our people. Second, build a more interconnected economic development belt. The six countries need to fully improve infrastructure connectivity, expand trade and investment and improve the network of industrial and supply chains and we also need to carry out closer cooperation on crossborder special economic zones to boost common development. Third, foster a more secure development environment. The six countries need to take security cooperation as a key cooperation area for the next stage, adopt the Operation of The Safety of the LancangMekong Region at an early date, combat subregional crossborder crimes, especially telecom fraud and online gambling, and eradicate the security problems jeopardizing peoples security and disrupting development. Fourth, move towards a more digital development prospect. Scitech authorities of the six countries are discussing the establishment of a subregional innovation corridor, and China is ready to carry out more cooperation on digital economy and innovation under the framework of such corridor. In accordance with the spirit of the Global AI Governance Initiative, China and the five Mekong countries will actively explore cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence. Fifth, deepen peopletopeople and cultural cooperation with more distinctive features. The six countries will carry out diverse forms of peopletopeople and cultural exchanges in tourism, sports, media, subnational cooperation, universities, youth and other fields, so as to enhance the friendship and affinity of the six peoples. Sixth, champion more inclusive cooperation. We will not engage in exclusive cliques and are committed to the right direction of regional economic integration. We will vigorously promote the coordinated development of the LMC with the Greater Mekong SubRegion economic cooperation, the Three River Basin Mechanism and the Mekong River Commission, and make the subregion a harmonious home of openness, inclusiveness, exchanges and mutual learning. The foreign ministers of the Mekong countries spoke highly of the positive progress made in LMC and appreciated Chinas positive contribution to promoting LMC. They agreed that LMC has become an important platform for maintaining regional peace and stability, promoting regional development and prosperity, and boosting industrialization and modernization of various countries. In the current complex and challenging international security and economic situation, LancangMekong countries should jointly advance subregional cooperation, deepen interdependence, make good use of institutional platforms and relevant funds, coordinate efforts for development and security, and respond to traditional and nontraditional security challenges in a coordinated manner. Some countries have also identified specific areas for strengthening industrialization cooperation, which is constructive and forwardlooking. All parties agreed to build a stronger LancangMekong Cooperation Economic Development Belt, deepen cooperation in priority areas such as connectivity, further unleash development potential, jointly address global challenges, and build an even closer LancangMekong community with a shared future. This foreign ministers meeting is efficient, pragmatic and productive, which has further strengthened the determination and confidence of the six countries to jointly build a community of shared future of peace and prosperity among MekongLancang countries. China will work with Mekong countries to jointly build an exemplar for Belt and Road cooperation, a pacesetter for implementing the Global Development Initiative, a pioneer for implementing the Global Security Initiative and a front runner for implementing the Global Civilization Initiative. We will build a more solid foundation for the LMC, enable it to move forward more steadily and make the pace more steady with broader prospect and bring more benefits to the people of countries in the region. Bloomberg Bloomberg today published a story with reporting that suggests that Chinese authorities in recent years have placed curbs on the ability of ethnic Mongolians in Inner Mongolia to express their ethnic identity such as the ability to study in schools using the Mongolian language. Given that Chinas policies pertaining to ethnic minorities have been a point of contention in the past between it and the US, the EU and others, does the foreign ministry expect such findings to have an impact on future diplomatic relations? Wang Wenbin Im not aware of the report. Can you explain the main opinions of it? Bloomberg The main opinions are that in a recent reporting trip to Inner Mongolia they found that in schools there students are no longer allowed to learn using ethnic Mongolian language and must learn using Chinese language. Wang Wenbin The relevant reporting team you mentioned once went to Inner Mongolia for interviews. If they were really objective, serious and careful enough to walk around the streets in Inner Mongolia, they would find that the socalled restrictions on the local language environment and the teaching of Mongolian are completely unfounded. The Chinese government upholds equality among all ethnic groups, and protects the freedom of all ethnic groups, including the Mongolians, to learn, use and develop their own spoken and written languages in accordance with the law. You asked whether Chinas relevant regulations will affect its relations with other countries. As long as other countries continue to develop relations with China in accordance with the principle of mutual respect and noninterference in other countries internal affairs, their relations with China will not be affected.  CCTV According to reports, the House of Representatives of the Philippines adopted a resolution on December  condemning Chinas illegal actions in the South China Sea. Do you have any comment? Wang Wenbin The resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the Philippines groundlessly criticized, misrepresented and smeared China. We firmly reject it. I would like to reiterate Chinas solemn position as follows First, China has indisputable sovereignty over Nanhai Zhudao, consisting of Dongsha Qundao, Xisha Qundao, Zhongsha Qundao and Nansha Qundao, and their adjacent waters, and has sovereign rights and jurisdiction over relevant waters. Chinas sovereignty, rights and interests in the South China Sea were established in the long course of history, and are solidly grounded in history and the law. Second, the Arbitral Tribunal in the South China Sea Arbitration violated the principle of state consent, exercised its jurisdiction ultra vires and rendered an award in disregard of the law. This is a grave violation of UNCLOS and general international law. The award is illegal, null and void. China does not accept or recognize it, and will never accept any claim or action based on the award. This is firmly grounded in international law. Chinas sovereignty and rights and interests in the South China Sea shall under no circumstances be affected by the illegal award. Any attempt to impose the illegal award on China is in violation of international law. Third, Chinas construction and deployment of necessary defense facilities on its own territory in Nansha Qundao, and the patrols by Chinese military and Coast Guard ships, the scientific research activities by relevant Chinese departments, and the fishing activities by Chinese fishing boats in waters under Chinas jurisdiction are all legitimate, lawful and beyond reproach. Fourth, Renai Jiao is part of Chinas Nansha Qundao. The Philippines illegally grounded a warship there and frequently sent vessels to illegally intrude into the reefs adjacent waters to deliver construction materials in an attempt to reinforce the grounded warship. This amounts to grave infringement on Chinas sovereignty. China will continue to do what is necessary to firmly safeguard its sovereignty in accordance with domestic and international law. Fifth, Chinas summer fishing moratorium in the South China Sea is a normal measure aimed at protecting marine biological resources in waters under its jurisdiction and a concrete step in fulfilling its obligations under international law including UNCLOS. The Philippine side should not make wanton remarks about this. Sixth, for some time, the Philippines has been sending people to Tiexian Jiao and other uninhabited islands and reefs of Chinas Nansha Islands and sending aircraft and vessels to intrude into adjacent waters and airspace of Chinas Nansha Islands and Huangyan Dao. These moves severely violate Chinas sovereignty, endanger Chinas security, go against the spirit of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea DOC and undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea. China has made serious dmarches for nearly  times and officially expressed our protest to the Philippines. We once again urge the Philippines to stop hyping up maritime disputes between China and the Philippines, stop its infringement of Chinas sovereignty and provocation at sea, return to the right track of resolving maritime disputes through negotiation and consultation as soon as possible and work with China to safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea. Kyodo News During a meeting with Chief Representative Yamaguchi Natsuo of Japans Komeito party on December , Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao said that efforts will be made to promote exchanges and communication between parties and political figures and other areas. The communication between the ruling parties in China and Japan, however, has not been officially resumed. Whats Chinas attitude towards this? Wang Wenbin China is open to exchanges and cooperation with Japan, including interparty exchanges. We hope that Japan will work with China to follow the important mutual understandings reached by the leaders of the two countries, act on the principles and consensus in the four political documents between China and Japan, and align efforts to improve bilateral ties with the commitment to promoting a strategic relationship of mutual benefit, and work hard towards the goal of building a constructive and stable ChinaJapan relationship fit for the new era. Beijing Daily According to reports, UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres, based on Article  of the UN Charter, wrote to the rotating president of the Security Council saying that the situation in Gaza may threaten world peace and security and calling on the Security Council to take steps to realize humanitarian ceasefire and averting an even worse humanitarian disaster. Its the first time in over five decades for the UN SecretaryGeneral to invoke Article . Whats Chinas comment? Wang Wenbin As this round of PalestinianIsraeli conflict drags on and causes severe humanitarian disaster, the call of the UN SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres reflects the strong concern of the international community on the serious situation in Gaza. The world must take more active steps to save lives and restore peace. The Security Council should listen to the call of the vast Arab and Islamic countries and the international community, take further and timely actions, realize a comprehensive ceasefire, protect civilians and ease the humanitarian situation. The recently released Position Paper of the Peoples Republic of China on Resolving the PalestinianIsraeli Conflict fully reflects the abovementioned position. China supports the mediation work of the UN SecretaryGeneral and the UN Secretariat, we will continue to enhance coordination with relevant sides and play a constructive role in deescalating the situation.  Reuters Could you tell us has Zambias official creditor committee cochaired by China reached an agreement on how they define comparability of treatment and what they want from Zambias bondholders to achieve that? And have any further meetings been held on Zambias debt, either just the official creditor committee or the committee with Zambia and all the bondholders? Wang Wenbin China takes Zambias debt issue seriously and has always been actively advancing the settlement of debts by the Creditor Committee for Zambia. China always calls on parties to participate in Zambias debt treatment in accordance with the principle of joint actions and fair burdensharing, and the aim is to comprehensively, systematically and effectively help Zambia emerge from the debt crisis. The Creditor Committee for Zambia is in consultations on this and relevant Chinese authorities will continue to participate in relevant process with a professional and responsible attitude. Bloomberg The US and Mexico signed an agreement on screening foreign investments specifically in relation to Chinese companies. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on the development? Wang Wenbin China believes that restricting normal trade and investment activities and disrupting relevant cooperation for political purposes does not serve the interests of any party. We hope the US will not overstretch the concept of national security, respect market rules and the principle of fair competition, and provide an open, fair, just and nondiscriminatory environment for the investment and operation of companies from all countries in the US. China News Service The th ChinaEU Summit was held in Beijing yesterday. Can you share the major agendas as well as the outcomes and common understandings reached at the summit? EU leaders have spoken positively of the summit, but at the same time expressed their high concern over trade imbalance and excess production capacity. What is Chinas response? Wang Wenbin This years ChinaEU Summit coincides with the th anniversary of the ChinaEU comprehensive strategic partnership and the th anniversary of the ChinaEU Summit mechanism. President Xi Jinping met with the two EU Presidents and Premier Li Qiang held the summit with them. The two sides exchanged views on strategic issues bearing on the ChinaEU relations, dialogue and cooperation in various fields, major concerns of the two sides, global governance and major international and regional issues. Both sides believe that the talks are candid, deepgoing and productive, and that the two sides have enhanced mutual understanding, deepened strategic communication, and built up consensus for cooperation. First, the summit charted the course for the growth of ChinaEU relations. The two sides agreed to fully leverage the guiding role of the ChinaEU Summit and the five highlevel dialogues, step up dialogue and cooperation, properly manage differences, and make ChinaEU relations more stable and mutually beneficial. Second, the summit identified key areas for closer mutually beneficial cooperation. Dialogue and cooperation will be stepped up in such areas as trade and investment, green development, digital economy, artificial intelligence, geographical indication, intellectual property rights and export control. Third, the summit demonstrated the two sides willingness to resume crossborder travel and enhance peopletopeople exchange. The two sides agreed to hold another meeting of the ChinaEU highlevel peopletopeople dialogue. Fourth, the summit sent out a strong message of ChinaEU joint response to global challenges. The two sides agreed to support and practice multilateralism, step up international coordination, advance reforms of the WTO and the international financial system, and jointly respond to global challenges such as climate change, bio diversity, food security and public health. On the issue of trade imbalance, we must see that the current situation in ChinaEU trade is the result from the combined influence of macroeconomic environment, international trade conditions and the two sides industrial structures. One should not simply put the responsibility on one side only, or blame market access. As for the EUs repeated claim that its trade deficit against China surged last year, it was largely affected by energy price and geopolitical factors and was quite a special phenomenon. This year, the trade deficit has greatly decreased. China has never deliberately pursued trade surplus. Chinas mega market will remain open to the EU and we welcome EU companies to share in the opportunities arising from Chinas highquality development and highlevel opening up. At the same time, we hope that the EU will ease the export restrictions on hightech products. This will effectively improve trade balance. Excess production capacity is a relative term. One cannot just see the demand of a specific country or region, but needs to view it from the perspective of economic globalization. Chinas new energy industry enjoys international competitiveness and can play an important role in the EUs green transition and the global response to climate change. We hope the EU will see this issue from an objective and just manner. China is not to blame for the inadequate impetus for the EUs industrial growth, and the EU should not take this as a pretext to adopt trade protectionist measures. China stands ready to work with the EU to deliver on the important common understandings reached at the summit, remain committed to our partnership, to mutuallybeneficial cooperation and to dialogue and consultation, properly manage differences and promote the sound, steady and sustained growth of ChinaEU relations. Bloomberg I just had a clarification question from your earlier announcement on the visa fees. Is that for all countries or only specific countries? Wang Wenbin It applies to all Chinese embassies and consulates overseas. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on December 7, 2023"," At the invitation of the government of Argentina, President Xi Jinpings Special Envoy and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress Wu Weihua will attend the inauguration of the incoming President of Argentina Javier Milei in Buenos Aires on December . ANSA Italy has formally informed Beijing of its decision to end its participation in the Belt and Road Initiative it joined in . Is it possible to get any comment on this topic? What does it mean from the Chinese point of view? What does it mean for the SinoItalian relations? Wang Wenbin The Belt and Road Initiative, proposed a decade ago, has delivered benefits to over  countries, becoming a most popular international public good and largest platform for international cooperation. In October this year, the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation was held in Beijing. A total of  countries, including Italy, and  international organizations sent representatives to the event, which produced  deliverables. The success of the forum sends out a clear message of seeking solidarity, collaboration, openness and winwin results and demonstrates the enormous appeal and global influence of Belt and Road cooperation. China firmly opposes attempts to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation or stoke bloc confrontation and division. Xinhua News Agency At the recent th Conference of the Parties COP to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC, more than  countries agreed to triple the installed capacity of renewable energy before . Foreign media commented that China is the only major country at COP that is expected to achieve that goal. Whats your comment? Wang Wenbin China attaches great importance to the development of renewable energy, and turned from followers to forerunners and even pacesetters in a short timespan. New heights are constantly achieved in installed capacity, power generation, and industrial competitiveness. We are making solid strides in deepening the energy revolution, contributing to the global response to climate change. Chinas investment in renewable energy has topped the world for seven years in a row. The installed capacity of renewable energy also topped the world, exceeding . terawatt, higher than the coalfired energy. More than half of the NEVs are in China. Green and lowcarbon development has become part of the life of the Chinese people. At the Hangzhou Asian Games successfully held not long ago, the conventional power of all the stadiums was generated with green energy. More than  million people contributed their green energy with lowcarbon activities, making the Hangzhou Asian Games the first ever carbonneutral Asian Games. We are actively promoting green energy internationally, assisting more developing countries in writing green chapters in their development. From the Karot Hydropower Project in Pakistan to the De Aar Wind Power Project in South Africa, and to the Al Dhafra PV Solar Power Plant in the UAE, Chinacontracted renewable projects are all over the world, lighting up the dreams of green and lowcarbon development of more countries. Currently,  percent of the worlds wind power equipment and  percent of the PV equipment are from China. By September this year, China had signed  SouthSouth MOUs on climate change with dozens of developing countries, built four demonstration zones on lowcarbon development, carried out  projects on the mitigation and adaptation of climate change, and brought the benefit of green and lowcarbon development to more countries. China will continue to promote green and sustainable development, contributing to the global response to climate change to the best of our capabilities. We also hope that members of the COP could fully implement the consensus, making corresponding contributions to achieve relevant targets according to their national conditions, and jointly addressing the challenges and bottlenecks facing the development of the renewable energy, making relentless efforts in implementing the Paris Agreement fully and effectively to build a clean and beautiful world. Beijing Daily Japans National Institute for Defense Studies issued the China Security Report  recently, which says that as China builds up its military strength, including nuclear power, and deepens strategic coordination with Russia, the US will have to face more intense rivalry from China and Russia in the future. The report also says that Japan must further strengthen the necessary defense capabilities to deter Chinas attempts to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait through reliance on force. What is Chinas comment? Wang Wenbin China is committed to peaceful development and adheres to a national defense policy that is defensive in nature. Chinas growth means a stronger force for world peace. Taiwan is part of China and the Taiwan question is Chinas internal affair. How to resolve the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese and brooks no external interference. The report of the Japanese think tank pointed fingers at Chinas internal affairs, modernization of Chinas military and Chinas relations with other countries. The comments are irresponsible and dont hold water. For historical reasons, Japans military and security moves have been closely watched by its Asian neighbors and the international community. In recent years, Japan has greatly increased its military expenditure and sought to develop offensive weapons, which has caused grave concern from its neighbors and the international community. We urge Japan to earnestly respect the security concerns of its neighbors, profoundly reflect on its history of aggression, stop hyping up the China threat narrative and using it as a pretext for its own military buildup, and take substantive steps to earn the trust of its Asian neighbors and the international community.  The New York Times Have the talks so far with EU leaders produced any substantive progress on relations? Wang Wenbin This morning, President Xi Jinping met with President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen who are in China for the th ChinaEU Summit. Id like to take this opportunity to share some information on that with you. President Xi noted that since the end of last year, the ChinaEU relations have shown a sound momentum of consolidation and growth, and the highlevel dialogues between the two sides in strategic, economic and trade, green and digital fields have produced rich results, which meets the interests of both sides and the expectations of our people. China and the EU are two major forces advancing multipolarity, two major markets in support of globalization, and two major civilizations championing diversity. In the current international landscape of increasing turbulence, the ChinaEU relations are of strategic significance and global influence, bearing on world peace, stability and prosperity. The two sides have the responsibility to jointly provide the world with more stability and impetus for development. President Xi stressed that this year marks the th anniversary of the ChinaEU comprehensive strategic partnership. Both sides need to take stock of past experience, navigate the trend of the world, and uphold the comprehensive strategic partnership. The two sides need to consolidate the political foundation, view each other from a strategic perspective, give full play to the leading role of the leaders meeting and the five highlevel dialogues, strengthen strategic communication, and enhance understanding and properly handle differences through constructive dialogue. The two sides need to form a correct perception, enhance mutual understanding and trust, honor commitments with good faith, and focus on growing our relations. We should not regard each other as rivals just because we have different systems, reduce cooperation just because there is competition, or engage in confrontation just because we have differences. The economies of China and Europe are highly complementary, and the two sides need to do more to cement the bond of shared interests between China and Europe through deeper and broader cooperation. Chinas economic growth has maintained a momentum of steady and sound growth. China is pursuing highquality development and highlevel openingup, and is willing to regard the EU as a key partner in economic and trade cooperation, a priority partner in scientific and technological cooperation, and a reliable partner in industrial and supply chain cooperation, in pursuit of mutual benefit and common development. The two sides need to enhance complementarity in market, capital and technology, promote the upgrading of traditional industries and the development of emerging industries, explore new models of cooperation, create new growth areas, and work together to improve industrial and supply chains. The two sides also need to strengthen peopletopeople exchanges and facilitate crossborder travels. President Xi Jinping stressed that the Chinese modernization and the integration of the EU are strategic decisions made by China and the EU with an eye to the future. China and the EU should respect and support each other, strengthen the synergy of development strategies and achieve common development. The Belt and Road Initiative is an open platform that has brought tangible benefits to more than  countries and people around the world. China is ready to continue to promote highquality Belt and Road cooperation, including synergizing with the EUs Global Gateway initiative, to help developing countries accelerate their development. The two sides should strengthen communication and coordination under the frameworks of the United Nations, the Group of  and others, adhere to multilateralism, oppose bloc confrontation, promote political solutions to international and regional hotspot issues, and carry out dialogues and cooperation on major issues concerning the future of mankind, such as artificial intelligence, so as to contribute to the wellbeing of mankind and addressing global challenges. President Charles Michel and President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU and China are the worlds two major forces, and are important economic and trade partners for each other, with the field of cooperation getting increasingly broader. EUChina cooperation is reciprocal and equalfooted. Sound management and development of the EUChina relationship is directly related to the interests of the two peoples, and the worlds prosperity and security. The EU attaches great importance to its relationship with China, does not want to decouple from China, and looks forward to building longterm, stable, predictable and sustainable development with China. It is hoped that this meeting will give new impetus to the future development of EUChina relations. The EU is pleased to see the results of the highlevel dialogues in various fields since this year, and believes that the longterm and stable development of Chinas economy is in the interests of the EU. It hopes that the two sides will continue to strengthen dialogues and cooperation in economy and trade, green and digital development, and so on, and make joint efforts to safeguard the stability and security of the supply chain and industrial chain, strengthen dialogues and seek cooperation on such major global issues as climate change and artificial intelligence, which concerns the future of mankind. The EU is committed to the oneChina policy. It stands ready to step up communication with China on differences in the spirit of mutual respect, openness and candidness to enhance mutual understanding. The two sides shoulder shared responsibilities for and have common interests in peace and stability in the world. The EU is ready to have close communication and collaboration with China to uphold multilateralism and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and to facilitate the resolution of regional hotspot issues including in Ukraine and the Middle East. As we can see from the readout, it was a useful meeting where both sides sent out a positive message of China and the EU working together for further progress in our relations. Later on, Premier Li Qiang will jointly chair the th ChinaEU Summit with the two EU leaders. We will release information on that in a timely manner as well. Please stay tuned. AFP A US State Department official said yesterday that Washington was monitoring reports of Chinese warships docking at a Cambodian port. Could you confirm this? Which are the warships that have docked at the Cambodian port? Is this the first time that Chinese warships have docked in Cambodia? Is there a plan for them to participate in military exercises? Wang Wenbin China and Cambodia enjoy a profound friendship. Our two countries have had fruitful cooperation in various sectors. As to the visit by Chinese navy ships to Cambodia, Id refer you to the competent authorities.  CCTV China just announced that General Secretary and President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to Viet Nam. How does China view the current ChinaViet Nam relations? Can you share whats on the agenda of the visit and Chinas expectation? Wang Wenbin China and Viet Nam are both socialist countries and neighbors. After the th CPC National Congress at the end of last year, General Secretary and President Xi Jinping invited General Secretary of the Communist Party of Viet Nam Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong for a visit to China. The two leaders jointly charted the course for the ChinaViet Nam comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. This year has seen frequent highlevel interactions, close exchanges between various departments and regions, and deeper cooperation in various fields, which have brought tangible benefits to the peoples of the two countries. The world is in a new period of disorder and transformation, with increasing instabilities and uncertainties. China and Viet Nam are both socialist countries and both are advancing reform and transformation that fits their respective national realities. Greater solidarity, closer friendship and deeper mutuallybeneficial cooperation is in the common interests of both sides and conducive to peace, stability and prosperity of the region and the wider world. During the visit, General Secretary Xi Jinping will hold talks respectively with General Secretary of the Communist Party of Viet Nam Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong and State President Vo Van Thuong and meet with Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh of Viet Nam and Chairman of the National Assembly Vuong Dinh Hue. The two sides will discuss upgrading the ChinaViet Nam relations, focus on six major areas including politics, security, practical cooperation, public support, multilateral affairs and maritime issues, and work to deepen and substantiate the comprehensive strategic cooperation between the two countries. This will help both countries to jointly follow their modernization paths with respective features, enrich the paths to modernization for developing countries and bring more benefits to the two peoples. The New York Times Europe has been expressing more concern this year about security issues in connection with China. Is Europe following Americas views on security and Ukraine instead of assessing Europes own interests? What is Chinas view? Wang Wenbin China always views its relations with Europe from a strategic height and longterm perspective and sees Europe as a comprehensive strategic partner and an important force in a multipolar world. We support the EU in upholding strategic autonomy, working together with China to practice true multilateralism and jointly striving to safeguard world peace, promote common development and tackle global challenges.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on December 6, 2023"," As agreed with the Mekong countries, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and the LancangMekong Cooperation LMC cochair Myanmars Deputy Prime Minister and Union Minister for Foreign Affairs U Than Swe will jointly host the eighth LMC Foreign Ministers Meeting in Beijing on December . CCTV To follow up on your announcement that Foreign Minister Wang Yi will host the eighth LancangMekong Cooperation LMC Foreign Ministers Meeting on December , how does China see the current development of LMC and what is Chinas expectation for the meeting? Wang Wenbin LMC is the first new subregional cooperation mechanism jointly initiated and launched by the six LancangMekong countries. Over the past seven years since its launch, the six LancangMekong countries have built up consensus and worked together at the LMC platform in the spirit of mutual benefit for common development, and achieved a number of practical outcomes. Connectivity projects such as the ChinaLaos Railway, the ChinaThailand Railway and the Siem ReapAngkor International Airport have boosted the regions trade and crossborder travel, doubling the annual trade volume between China and the Mekong countries over the past seven years. The LMC Special Fund has supported hundreds of livelihood cooperation projects, including the LMC Bumper Harvest Projects, the LancangMekong Sweet Spring Action, and the Green LancangMekong Initiative, bringing tangible benefits to the people of these countries. Amid changes and instability in the world, China attaches great importance to the LMC Foreign Ministers Meeting. We hope to have an indepth exchange of views with Mekong countries at the meeting on deeper and more substantive cooperation, jointly make the region an exemplar for highquality Belt and Road cooperation, a pacesetter for implementing the Global Development Initiative, a pioneer for implementing the Global Security Initiative and a front runner for implementing the Global Civilization Initiative, and build a LancangMekong community with a shared future that enjoys close peopletopeople bond, mutual help and common prosperity. AFP The ChinaEU Summit will be held in Beijing this week. Yesterday, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU will not tolerate over time an imbalance in the trade relationship between the EU and China. She added that We have tools to protect our market, but we prefer to have negotiated solutions. What is Chinas response to this? Is China concerned over the possibility of a trade war with the EU in the future? Wang Wenbin First of all, let me say that China has never deliberately sought trade surplus. On the contrary, we have consistently advanced highlevel opening up and invited all countries to share Chinas mega market with a population of over . billion by hosting the China International Import Expo and the China International Supply Chain Expo. The current ChinaEU trade situation is a result under the combined influence of macroeconomic environment, international trade conditions and the industrial structures of the two sides. Besides, in light of the deep integration of global industrial and supply chains, trade statistics does not reflect the profit distribution in ChinaEU trade. Over onethird of export from EU companies in China was sold to the EU. Although China appears to have the trade surplus, in fact, the EU has reaped considerable profits. Moreover, trade involves both sides. If the EU sets strict restrictions on the export of hightech products to China on the one hand, and on the other, hopes to greatly increase export to China, this may not be a reasonable expectation. When it comes to tackling the prominent problems faced by Europe and effectively addressing global challenges, China is a reliable and indispensable partner for the EU. Properly settling differences through dialogue and consultation is an important lesson weve learned from how the ChinaEU relations have grown. We hope the EU will work with China together to create sound atmosphere for the upcoming ChinaEU summit and make joint efforts for the sound and steady growth of ChinaEU relations.  Jiji Press According to reports, China has recently tightened export control over urea and ammonium phosphate. The export of urea is suspended and the export inspection application for ammonium phosphate was also asked to stop. What are the reasons behind this? Can the Foreign Ministry share some comment?

According to what we have learned from competent authorities, in the first ten months of this year, China has exported . million tonnes of fertilizer in total, up by . percent yearonyear, making itself a major participant in international fertilizer trade. As for your specific question, Id refer you to competent authorities. Beijing Youth Daily It was reported that the International Symposium Commemorating the th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was held in Beijing recently. Can you share more information? Wang Wenbin On December , the China Foundation for Human Rights Development held the International Symposium Commemorating the th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Beijing. Senior officials from Asian, African, Latin American and European countries and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights as well as diplomats in China, experts and scholars, and representatives from civil society organizations attended the symposium. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the opening ceremony and delivered a keynote speech, in which he elaborated on the important views of President Xi Jinping on human rights, Chinas human rights development path, and Chinas position and propositions on global human rights governance. Relevant parties had indepth discussions at the symposium on the promotion of economic, social and cultural rights, human rights development paths and global human rights governance, and shared their insights on ways of reforming and improving global human rights governance under the new situation. The Beijing Declaration issued at the symposium reflects international consensus and provides useful ideas on advancing the worlds human rights cause. China stands ready to take this symposium as an opportunity to work with all parties to uphold the common values of mankind, step up human rights dialogue and cooperation, deepen exchanges and mutual learning, take an active part in global human rights governance, protect and promote human rights through security, development and cooperation, advance the worlds human rights cause, and jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind. Reuters Moodys on Tuesday put a downgrade warning on Chinas credit rating and said it expected Chinas economic growth to slow over the coming decade. Is there anything the foreign ministry has to offer to put foreign investors at ease, so that they will not be concerned about investing in China? Wang Wenbin The Ministry of Finance of China has made response to that, which you may refer to. Id like to stress that since the beginning of this year, Chinas macroeconomy has seen a sustained rebound and steady progress in highquality development. New growth drivers of Chinas economy are delivering results. China is capable of deepening reform and addressing risks and challenges. Multiple international institutions recently revised up their forecasts of Chinas economic growth for this year, expressing optimism about the strong internal driving force, resilience and potential of Chinas economy. The IMF and OECD revised up Chinas growth forecasts of  to . percent and . percent respectively. The fundamentals sustaining Chinas sound economic growth in the long run stay unchanged and will not change in the future. We have the confidence and ability to realize longterm steady development. Concerns expressed by Moodys over Chinas economic prospect and fiscal sustainability are unnecessary. Just as some friends from the business community have said, China has become a synonym of the best investment destination. The nextChina is still China. We invite businesses from across the world to invest and cultivate success in China.  NHK According to Hong Kong media reports, Agnes Chow Ting who is studying in Canada said she would not return to Hong Kong. In response to that, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR John Lee told an interview yesterday that they will do their utmost to pursue her and fugitives will be pursued for life unless they turn themselves in. Does the Foreign Ministry have any response to that? Wang Wenbin We support the government and judiciary of the Hong Kong SAR in performing their duties in accordance with the law. Global Times Its reported that the UN General Assembly UNGA at its th session adopted the resolution No first placement of weapons in outer space cosponsored by China and Russia, which reaffirms the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space and calls on countries to start talks on international legal instrument based on the Draft Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects PPWT introduced by China and Russia. Whats Chinas comment? Wang Wenbin Safeguarding the security and peace of the outer space and preventing an arms race in outer space is the longterm common aspiration of the international community. The first UN special session devoted to disarmament in  clearly proposed to prevent an arms race in outer space through negotiation. For over four decades since then, the UNGA has adopted relevant resolutions with overwhelming support every year that call for negotiations of new international legal instrument and reflect the concerns of the international community on moves that could turn outer space into a weapon or battlefield. China, Russia and other countries have submitted to the UNGA the draft resolution on No first placement of weapons in outer space for many years in a row, calling on countries to take effective measures to prevent an arms race in outer space and start negotiations on relevant international legal instrument at an early date. The fact that the resolution was adopted every year with strong support speaks to the international communitys firm support for negotiations on an international legal instrument on arms control in outer space and for not placing weapons in outer space. Regrettably, certain countries, unwilling to have their military buildup in outer space constrained, have long refused to acknowledge the fundamental approach of negotiating a legal instrument on technical grounds and even questioned the basic consensus of preventing an arms race in outer space. We hope relevant countries will demonstrate political will, correct their wrong practice, support and constructively participate in negotiations for a legal instrument on arms control in outer space, and uphold the international order based on international law. AFP Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said that  percent of voters in a referendum last week approved of the nations territorial claim on a huge chunk of neighboring Guyana. China is a firm ally for Venezuela and at the same time maintains friendly relations with Guyana. So does China support President Nicolas Maduros claim? Is China worried that Venezuela may invade Guyana? Wang Wenbin Venezuela and Guyana are both Chinas good friends. China always respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries. China always supports the two countries in properly settling the issue of demarcation of their boundary through friendly consultation. This is in the interests of the people of both countries and conducive to the stability, cooperation and development of Latin America and the Caribbean.

This means China has signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with all  Arab countries and the Arab League, achieving full coverage.

Japan has asked the US to have a thorough investigation into the accident and before finding the reasons, stop flying Osprey aircraft deployed in Japan. But the US ignored this demand and continued flying the aircraft. What is Chinas comment? Wang Wenbin The US military, while professing that it safeguards the regions peace and stability, has behaved unscrupulously under the protection of exterritoriality. While professing it protects the security of allies, the US has in fact become a source of insecurity for its allies. According to statistics from the government of Okinawa Prefecture, by the end of , US Forces Japan has committed over , criminal crimes and produced over  air accidents in Okinawa. The Osprey aircraft involved in this accident has experienced multiple severe accidents, leaving many injured, dead or missing.

My question is, is China formally recognizing the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan? Wang Wenbin As a longstanding friendly neighbor of Afghanistan, China believes that Afghanistan should not be excluded from the international community. We hope Afghanistan will further respond to the expectations of the international community, build an open and inclusive political structure, adopt moderate and prudent domestic and foreign policies, firmly combat all forms of terrorist forces, develop friendly relations with other countries, especially with its neighbors, and integrate itself into the world community. We believe that diplomatic recognition of the Afghan government will come naturally as the concerns of various parties are effectively addressed.  CCTV China started to extend unilateral visafree policy to six countries, namely France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia on December .

Nearly , travelers from the six countries entered China, with the daily average up by  percent from November . Nearly , of these travelers or  percent of the total came on the visafree policy.

Going forward, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to adjust visa policies to create more favorable conditions and further facilitate crossborder travel. Reuters According to Japanese media, a Chinese citizen was arrested by Japanese police for suspicion of leaking business secret. Do you have any comment? Can you share more information on this?

Phoenix TV Leader of the Taiwan region Tsai Ingwen recently said at a DPP campaign rally that we dont want Hong Kongstyle peace, we want peace with dignity, the  general election is not a choice between peace and war, and it is the people of Taiwan who must choose peace with dignity. What is your comment? Wang Wenbin This is not a question on foreign affairs. Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinas territory. The election in the Taiwan region is purely Chinas internal affair. I would like to stress that Taiwan independence is as incompatible with crossStrait peace as fire with water. Taiwan independence means war and Taiwan independence is a dead end. Whatever highsounding rhetoric the DPP authorities try to use, it cannot cover up their malicious attempt to tie Taiwan residents to the war chariot of Taiwan independence it cannot change the fact that Taiwan independence elements are doomed to failure and it cannot stop the irreversible trend of reunification of China.

She also urged US business leaders to put national security above short term revenue. What is your comment on this? Wang Wenbin President Biden once noted that the US is not seeking to halt Chinas economic development or scientific and technological progress. However, the remarks of the US official contradict this. It will hardly win the trust from China and the rest of the world, and reveals the deepseated ColdWar mentality and hegemonic mindset of some in the US. China never bets against the US, and has no intention to challenge or unseat it. The US needs to have a right understanding of China, work with China to earnestly deliver on the important common understandings reached between the two Presidents in their meeting in San Francisco, stop viewing China as an enemy, correct the wrong move of carrying out majorcountry confrontation under the pretext of competition, and avoid saying one thing and doing another. I read some comment on Chinese media platforms, which I would like to cite here and hope the US will seriously reflect on it.

During the CISCE, the international business community launched the Beijing Initiative for the Connectivity of Industrial and Supply Chains. Companies from home and abroad connected by industrial and supply chains showcased their advancements, deepened cooperation and gained substantively from the CISCE.

Peoples Daily November  marks the th anniversary of the ChinaEurope Railway Express Xian, which has seen over , trips, accounting for a quarter of all trips made under the Railway Express. How do you see the role played by the ChinaEurope Railway Express in promoting the economic development of countries along the routes? Wang Wenbin Over the past decade, the ChinaEurope Railway Express has grown into a bustling network, contributing to keeping global industrial and supply chains stable and injecting new impetus into the world economic development. It has become a flagship project and a signature brand of Belt and Road cooperation. The Railway Express has built a new land transportation corridor, promoting winwin cooperation in Eurasia. It runs through more than  cities in  Asian countries and regions and reaches more than  cities in  European countries. Thanks to its development, the cargo transportation time between China and Europe can be shortened by more than  days from shipping by sea, which means quality products from China and Europe can reach each others markets more quickly. Over the past decade, with strong demand for crossborder transport, a total of , trips were made under the Railway Express, covering over  million kilometers. It has shipped more than . million TEUs of goods worth over USD  billion, giving a strong boost to international economic and trade cooperation, promoting economic development and livelihood improvement in countries and regions along the routes, and contributing to the unfettered operation of global industrial and supply chains. The ChinaEurope Railway Express is a vivid example of the steady progress in Belt and Road cooperation. With expanding sources of goods and more hightech products, the Railway Express is transforming from featuring a simple corridor economy to a valueadded one. It is benefiting countries and regions along the routes with highquality development. The ChinaEurope Railway Express originates from China, connects Asia and Europe, and benefits the whole world. President Xi Jinping announced at the opening ceremony of the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation that China will speed up highquality development of the ChinaEurope Railway Express. China will continue to work with partners in Asia and Europe to usher in another decade of a twoway journey full of opportunities and to embrace a bright future of highquality Belt and Road cooperation. CCTV Frances Jacques Delors Institute recently released a report saying that for the EU, leveraging China to realize its own development is a necessary choice. The report called on the EU to always be rational on derisking, uphold a more rational and pragmatic China policy, and enhance mutually beneficial cooperation in energy, the green sector and technology. Whats Chinas comment? Wang Wenbin We noted the report you mentioned which reflects that people with insights in Europe are positive about the prospect of growing ChinaEU relations and that the relationship enjoys solid foundation in the people. China and the EU are partners, not rivals. ChinaEU cooperation should be a positive cycle that enables our mutual success, not a knockout match which results in only one winner. Certain individuals selectively emphasize on competing aspects between China and the EU, deliberately overlook partnerships and hype up derisking with China and reducing dependence on China. Such misconception on China not only will reinforce misunderstanding and erode mutual trust, but also goes against the EUs longheld position of upholding free trade and WTO rules and disrupts the growth of ChinaEU relations, which does not serve any ones interests. China believes that the risk that we need to get rid of the most is confrontation and rivalry caused by politicizing all issues and the dependence that needs to be reduced the most is the act of resorting to protectionism. China and the EU are important parts of the global industrial and supply chains and staunch force in building an open world economy. We hope that the EU side can listen to rational voices, steer clear of politicizing all issues or overstretching the concept of security, and work with China to maintain twoway opening up instead of erecting walls and barriers, promote trade and investment liberalization instead of trade protectionism, create a fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory business environment for companies of both sides, advance sound and steady growth of ChinaEU relationship and inject more stability and certainty for a volatile and turbulent world.
