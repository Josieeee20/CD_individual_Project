"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on January 17, 2024"," At the invitation of the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo FÃ©lix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo, President Xi Jinpingâs Special Envoy and Vice Chairperson of the National Committee of the Chinese Peopleâs Political Consultative Conference Shen Yueyue will attend the inauguration of President Tshisekedi in DRCâs capital Kinshasa on January 20. CGTN: Taiwan media claimed that sources say Nauruâs surprise break of âdiplomatic tiesâ with Taiwan was achieved through behind-the-scenes manipulation by a former president of the country. While Taiwan was still assessing and having consultations on Nauruâs demand for economic aid, the mainland took the opportunity to persuade Nauru to switch ties. What is the Foreign Ministryâs comment on this? Mao Ning: To recognize the one-China principle, break âdiplomatic tiesâ with Taiwan and seek to restore diplomatic relations with China is the collective decision of the Nauru cabinet and a right choice independently made by Nauru as a sovereign country. We noted that the parliament of Nauru unanimously adopted a resolution yesterday, supporting, endorsing and affirming the Nauru governmentâs decision to resume diplomatic relations with China and committing itself to strengthening Nauruâs diplomatic ties with China and the cordial relations between the two sovereign nations. This once again shows that the one-China principle is where global opinion trends and where the arc of history bends. The âsourcesâ of the so-called claims are nothing but ill-intentioned speculation. Those who see âdollar diplomacyâ as a go-to tool need to understand that there are things that money cannot buy. The one-China principle is a fundamental principle that cannot be traded and a prevailing international consensus. China is the worldâs second largest economy. Restoring and developing diplomatic relations and carrying out practical cooperation in various fields with China promise broad prospects and will bring unprecedented development opportunities for Nauru. China Daily: The World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024 held in Davos, Switzerland receives world attention. There are two voices at the meeting. One is for de-risking with export controls and other measures in trade for national security. The other is for cooperation as itâs the only way to rekindle dynamism and solve problems. Whatâs your comment?â Mao Ning: Premier Li Qiang attended the annual meeting and delivered a special address. He stressed that in todayâs world with very close economic linkages between countries, fragmented and separate responses will only leave the world economy more fragile. China believes that what truly serves the common interests of all is to fully respect the laws of international industrial specialization, firmly advance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, tighten the bond of cooperation, and make the pie of mutual benefit bigger. Countries need to step up dialogue and communication, take more coordinated and effective measures, firmly uphold the multilateral trading system, jointly improve global economic governance, and foster new drivers of global growth. As the second largest economy in the world, China is an important engine of global development with its contribution to world economic growth at around 30 percent over the years. China is now advancing Chinese modernization on all fronts through high-quality development and will continue to provide strong impetus for the world economy. China has a supersize market with rapidly unlocked demand. In face of weak global demand, market becomes the most scarce resource. The Chinese market, with its vast space and growing depth, will play an important role in boosting aggregate global demand. China will remain firmly committed to opening up, share our opportunities and develop together with all in the world. As underlined by Premier Li Qiang, China embraces investments from businesses of all countries with open arms, and will work tirelessly to foster a market-oriented, law-based and world-class business environment. Choosing the Chinese market is not a risk, but an opportunity. China will open its door still wider to the world.â  Reuters: Nauru had ties with China in 2002, but it switched to Taiwan in 2005 and now it has switched back to China. Our question is, when will China establish an embassy in Nauru and vice versa, when will Nauru establish an embassy in Beijing? Mao Ning: We will release the specific arrangements on the reestablishment of diplomatic ties between China and Nauru in due course. I want to stress that as a collective decision made at the cabinet meeting, Nauru recognizes the one-China principle, breaks âdiplomatic tiesâ with Taiwan and seeks to reestablish diplomatic relations with China. This meets the aspiration of the people in Nauru, serves Nauruâs long-term interests, and is on the right side of history. Reuters: Does China see Nauru as a reliable partner given it has switched ties before? What guarantees does China have from Nauru for the country not to go back to Taiwan again? Mao Ning: China appreciates and welcomes Nauruâs decision to break âdiplomatic tiesâ with Taiwan and seek to resume diplomatic relations with China. We believe this is a right choice. China is ready to work with Nauru to open up a new chapter in our bilateral relations on the basis of the one-China principle. AFP: Canada unveiled on Tuesday restrictions on research funding citing national security concerns. Canada said it wants to prevent the sharing of advanced technologies with the entities of some countries, including China. Whatâs your response to this? Mao Ning: The Canadian government has gone after some universities and research institutions of China under the pretext of so-called national security risks. This seriously undermines sci-tech exchange and cooperation between China and Canada and is not conducive to improving and stabilizing the bilateral relations. China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this.â Sci-tech exchange and cooperation between China and Canada are two-way and mutually beneficial. The relevant policy of Canada is short-sighted and unwise and hurts others as well as itself. We urge Canada to abandon ideological bias and Cold War mentality, stop overstretching the concept of national security, stop politicizing sci-tech cooperation issues and using them as a tool, stop setting up barriers hindering normal sci-tech exchange and cooperation between China and Canada, and create conditions and atmosphere for the improvement and growth of bilateral relations, instead of doing the opposite.  Reuters: Will China offer to help Nauru in security and policing matters in the way that China has helped in their pact with the Solomon Islands? Mao Ning: After resuming diplomatic ties, the two sides will carry out cooperation in various fields on the basis of equality, mutual respect, mutually beneficial cooperation, openness and inclusiveness. We will not set restrictions for fields of cooperation, and the fields will be determined through talks between the two sides. Anadolu Agency: Pakistan condemned an air strike inside its territory yesterday. What is Chinaâs comment about tensions between two Shanghai Cooperation Organization allies? Mao Ning: China believes that the relations between countries should be handled based on the basic norms governing international relations underpinned by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and international law, and all countriesâ sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity should be earnestly respected and protected. Iran and Pakistan are close neighbors and major Islamic countries. We call on the two sides to exercise restraint, avoid actions that escalate the tension and jointly keep the region peaceful and stable. NHK: Last November, Australia accused a Chinese destroyer of causing injuries to Australian naval divers by operating its sonar. Chinaâs Ambassador to Australia just said that itâs the Japanese warship that launched the attack. Whatâs your comment? Mao Ning: I didnât know what exactly Ambassador Xiao Qian said.âWhen the incident happened last November, the Chinese military made a response and clarification.â "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on January 16, 2024"," CCTV: In the past few days, countries have been openly stating that they support the one-China principle, respect Chinaâs territorial integrity and oppose interference in Chinaâs internal affairs. Can you give us more details? Mao Ning: Since January 13, countries and international organizations have been openly reaffirming their commitment to the one-China principle, firm support for Chinaâs effort of upholding national sovereignty and territorial integrity, opposition to any form of âTaiwan independenceâ and support for Chinaâs reunification. Apart from what has been mentioned yesterday, a large number of countries, including Pakistan, the Maldives, Myanmar, Iran, Syria, Tunisia, Palestine, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Central Africa, Niger, Equatorial Guinea, Comoros, Lesotho, Somalia, Djibouti, Mali, Burundi, Gambia, Vanuatu, Tonga, Kiribati, Dominica, Nicaragua, and Bolivia as well as the African Union also clearly stated their support for the one-China principle and opposition to âTaiwan independenceâ. We applaud and appreciate the just position of these countries and organizations. We are convinced that the international community will continue to, in accordance with the one-China principle, support the Chinese peopleâs just cause of opposing âTaiwan independenceâ separatist activities and striving to achieve national reunification. AFP: The US State Department issued a statement, saying that while the Government of Nauruâs action to sever its diplomatic relationship with Taiwan is a sovereign decision, it is nonetheless a disappointing one. What is your response to the US State Departmentâs statement? Mao Ning: The US has pointed fingers at the decision independently made by a sovereign country, tried every means to smear Chinaâs diplomacy and encouraged the Taiwan region to expand âinternational spaceâ. This gravely violates the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiquÃ©s, seriously interferes in Chinaâs internal affairs and severely contravenes the basic norms governing international relations. China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this. I would like to stress that there is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinaâs territory, the government of the Peopleâs Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China, and the one-China principle is a universally recognized basic norm governing international relations and a prevailing international consensus. The government of Nauruâs decision to restore diplomatic relations with China once again shows that the one-China principle is where global opinion trends and where the arc of history bends. China urges the US to act seriously in accordance with the commitments that have been reaffirmed multiple times by the US leaders to not supporting âTaiwan independenceâ, âtwo Chinasâ or âone China, one Taiwanâ, handle Taiwan-related issues with utmost prudence, and stop sending any wrong signals to âTaiwan independenceâ separatist forces. CRI: Itâs reported that the Taiwan authorities yesterday accused the mainland of long-term suppression of the islandâs âdiplomatic spaceâ and luring Taiwanâs so-called âdiplomatic allies.â Whatâs your comment? Mao Ning: There is but one China in the world, the government of the Peopleâs Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinaâs territory. Standing up for the one-China principle is the right thing to do and is where global opinion trends and where the arc of history bends. We are convinced that more countries will choose to stand on the right side of history and the side of international justice and make the right decision that serves the fundamental and long-term interests of their countries and peoples. I want to stress that the one-China principle is a basic norm governing international relations and a prevailing consensus of the international community. The Chinese government never barters away principles. The DPP authorities in Taiwan disregard the prevailing trend of history, refuse the one-China principle, make every effort to expand the so-called âinternational spaceâ, and conduct separatist activities seeking âTaiwan independenceâ. This is doomed to failure and will lead nowhere.  Rudaw Media Network: Iran is attacking Erbil, the capital of Kurdistan region, with missiles and civilians have been targeted. What is Chinese position on that? My second question, China has good relations with Syria and TÃ¼rkiye. TÃ¼rkiye continues to attack Kurdish areas of Syria. Is China trying to calm the situation in the region? My last question, whatâs Chinaâs position on South Africaâs genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice?â Mao Ning: On your first question, China believes that Iraqâs sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity should be respected and protected. We call on relevant parties to exercise restraint, avoid actions that escalate the tension and jointly keep the region peaceful and stable. On your second question, China believes that the relations between countries should be handled in accordance with the basic norms of international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and international law, Syriaâs sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity should be earnestly respected and protected, and terrorism should be countered under the framework of international law. On your third question, we noted the relevant case. China is deeply saddened by the heavy civilian casualties caused by the latest Palestinian-Israeli conflict and opposes any actions in violation of international law. We hope parties to the conflict will earnestly implement the relevant resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council and General Assembly, reach an immediate and full ceasefire, and stop the collective punishment against people in Gaza. Shenzhen TV: After the government of Nauru announced the decision to break the so-called âdiplomatic tiesâ with the Taiwan authorities on January 15, Taiwanâs foreign affairs office said that Nauru cutting âdiplomatic tiesâ with Taiwan at this time is not only Chinaâs revenge on Taiwanâs âdemocratic electionsâ, but also a direct challenge to international order. What is your response? Mao Ning: By making these remarks, the Taiwan authorities are calling white black. The Taiwan question has nothing to do with democracy, but bears on Chinaâs sovereignty and territorial integrity. The âTaiwan independenceâ forces are using âdemocracyâ to cover up their hidden agenda of dividing the country. Their attempt is doomed to failure. Talking about international order, the return of Taiwan to China is an important part of the international order established after the second World War. This is clearly stipulated in the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation. Resolution 2758 adopted at the 26th Session of the UN General Assembly in 1971 makes it clear that there is no âtwo Chinasâ or âone China, one Taiwanâ in the world. Upholding the one-China principle is safeguarding international order. Challenging the one-China principle is challenging international order, and will meet the joint opposition of the international community.â Across the world, 182 countries have already established diplomatic relations with China on the basis of the one-China principle. Nauru decided to stand with the overwhelming majority of the international community and restore diplomatic ties with China. This is the right choice in line with its long-term interests and will open up a brighter future for its development.  Reuters: The World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024 is being held in Davos, Switzerland. Is China invited to a peace summit for Ukraine held by Switzerland? Will China send a delegation to the summit? Will Premier Li Qiang meet Ukrainian President Zelenskyy? Mao Ning: Chinaâs position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear, which is centered on promotingâtalks for peace. Since the full escalation of the crisis, China has kept in close contact with relevant parties, including Ukraine. We are willing to continue to work with the international community and play a constructive role for the political settlement of the crisis. We also welcome and support any efforts for peace. Bloomberg: Philippinesâ President Marcos said the following on the Taiwan election results: We look forward to close collaboration, strengthening mutual interests, fostering peace and ensuring prosperity for our peoples in the years ahead. Marcos wrote this on X on Monday night. He also referred to the new leader in Taiwan as President-elect. What is the Chinese Foreign Ministryâs response? Mao Ning: The remarks of Philippinesâ President gravely violate the one-China principle and the communiquÃ© on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Philippines, seriously go against the Philippinesâ political commitments to China, and blatantly interfere in Chinaâs internal affairs. China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this and has immediately lodged strong representations to the Philippine side. This morning, Assistant Foreign Minister Nong Rong summoned the Philippine Ambassador to China Jaime Florcruz to lodge serious dÃ©marche and urge the Philippines to present a responsible response to China. The election result of the Taiwan region cannot change the dynamics and direction of cross-Strait relations and cannot hold back the prevailing trend that China will and must achieve reunification. We would like to make it clear to the Philippines that it should refrain from playing with fire on the Taiwan question, earnestly abide by the one-China principle and the joint communiquÃ© of establishing diplomatic ties between China and the Philippines, immediately stop the wrong words and deeds on Taiwan-related issues and stop sending any wrong signal to âTaiwan independenceâ separatist forces. We suggest President Marcos read more to develop a proper understanding of the ins and outs of the Taiwan question and come to a right conclusion. Xinhua News Agency: Itâs reported that the US House of Representatives recently passed the Taiwan Non-Discrimination Act of 2023, requiring the Secretary of the Treasury to use Americaâs influence in International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support Taiwanâs membership in this organization. Whatâs your comment? Mao Ning: The US passed the so-called act to grossly interfere in Chinaâs internal affairs and attempt to manipulate the Taiwan question for political purposes to create âtwo Chinasâ and âone China, one Taiwan.â We strongly deplore and firmly oppose this, and have made serious representations to the US side. Taiwan does not have any ground, reason, or right to join the UN, or any other international organization whose membership is confined to sovereign states. On October 25, 1971, the 26th Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted, with an overwhelming majority, Resolution 2758, which decides to recognize the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of the Taiwan authorities from the place which they unlawfully occupy. Once and for all, UNGA Resolution 2758 resolved, politically, legally and procedurally, the issue of the representation of the whole of China, including Taiwan, at the UN. It also made it clear that there can only be one seat representing China at the UN, and that is the Peopleâs Republic of China. Over the past half century and more, Resolution 2758 has been observed by the UN, special agencies such as IMF, and other international and regional organizations. Any issues regarding the Taiwan regionâs participation in the activities of international organizations must be handled in accordance with the one-China principle. The US should fully understand the highly sensitive nature of the Taiwan question and immediately stop using the Taiwan question to interfere in Chinaâs internal affairs, sending wrong signals to the âTaiwan independenceâ forces and undermining China-US relations, and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.  Reuters: The Philippinesâ military chief said that the Filipino government will develop islands in the South China Sea to make them more habitable for troops. Whatâs your comment? Mao Ning: China has indisputable sovereignty over Nansha Qundao and the adjacent waters. We firmly oppose relevant countriesâ illegal construction on the islands and reefs they have illegally occupied in Nansha Qundao. Bloomberg: In the past two days, Hamas has released videos featuring one hostage Noa Argamani, whose mother was born in China, in what is referred to as a âsign of life video.â In December, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his parliament he summoned the Chinese Ambassador to request Chinaâs intervention on behalf of Noa. Did China take any action in the Noa case? And is China working behind the scenes to secure her release? Mao Ning: Since the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out, China has repeatedly called for the release of all those held captive as soon as possible and has been making active efforts for this. We will work with the international community to continue to play a constructive role for realizing a ceasefire and the release of all those held captive. RIA Novosti: Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Monday that Kiev wants to establish more dynamic relations with China and believes that Beijing can play a role in resolving the Ukrainian conflict. Whatâs Chinaâs comment on this? Mao Ning: Chinaâs position on the Ukraine crisis is centered on promoting talks for peace. China is in touch with relevant parties, including Ukraine. We will continue to play a constructive role for the political settlement of the crisis. We also stand ready to work with Ukraine to act on the important common understandings reached between the heads of state of China and Ukraine to advance our bilateral relations. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on January 15, 2024"," AFP: US senior delegation met with Lai Ching-te and Tsai Ing-wen in Taiwan today. What is your response to this? Mao Ning: The elections in Taiwan are the affairs of a region in China. China firmly opposes the US having any form of official interaction with Taiwan and interfering in Taiwan affairs in any way or under any pretext. We urge the US to have a clear understanding of the extreme complexity and sensitivity of the Taiwan question, earnestly abide by the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiquÃ©s, and act seriously in accordance with the commitments that have been reaffirmed multiple times by the US leaders to not supporting âTaiwan independenceâ, âtwo Chinasâ or âone China, one Taiwanâ, and not seeking to use the Taiwan question as a tool to contain China. The US needs to exercise extreme prudence in handling Taiwan-related issues, and must not obscure and hollow out the one-China principle in any form or send any wrong signal to âTaiwan independenceâ separatist forces. CCTV: The government of the Republic of Nauru officially announced its decision to recognize the one-China principle, break the so-called âdiplomatic tiesâ with the Taiwan authorities and seek to reestablish diplomatic ties with China. Whatâs your comment? Mao Ning: As an independent sovereign country, the Republic of Nauru announced that it recognizes the one-China principle, breaks the so-called âdiplomatic tiesâ with the Taiwan authorities and seeks to reestablish diplomatic ties with China. China appreciates and welcomes the decision of the government of the Republic of Nauru.â There is but one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinaâs territory, and the government of the Peopleâs Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. Itâs what has been affirmed in Resolution 2758 of the UN General Assembly and is a prevailing consensus among the international community. China has established diplomatic relations with 182 countries on the basis of the one-China principle. The Nauru governmentâs decision of reestablishing diplomatic ties with China once again shows that the one-China principle is where global opinion trends and where the arc of history bends. China stands ready to work with Nauru to open new chapters of our bilateral relations on the basis of the one-China principle.  CCTV: After the results of the two elections for 2024 in the Taiwan region were released, the Spokesperson of the Russian Foreign Ministry Maria Zakharova said that the Russian side opposes any form of Taiwanâs independence, and called on all outside forces to refrain from provocative actions undermining regional stability and international security. What is Chinaâs comment on this? Mao Ning: We appreciate the remarks of the Russian side. In fact, aside from Russia, many countries and international organizations, including Indonesia, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Laos, Bangladesh, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Nepal, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Belarus, Serbia, Hungary, Papua New Guinea, Cuba, Venezuela, the SCO and the Arab League, have, through issuing statements and press communiquÃ©s or answering questions from the press, publicly reaffirmed their commitment to the one-China principle, their firm support for Chinaâs effort to safeguard the nationâs sovereignty and territorial integrity, their opposition to any form of âTaiwan independenceâ and their support for Chinaâs cause toward reunification. This is the voice of justice and peace from the international community. It reflects the extensive consensus of the international community in firmly upholding the UN Charter and the basic norms governing international relations, and embodies the trend of the times and of history. We thank these countries for their understanding of and support for Chinaâs just position. Whatever changes take place in Taiwan, the basic fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China will not change. Taiwan has never been a country and will never be one. We believe that the international communityâs prevailing consensus on upholding the one-China principle and long-standing and overwhelming adherence to this principle will become more solid. The Chinese peopleâs just cause of opposing âTaiwan independenceâ separatism and external interference and striving for national reunification will win more understanding and support. Phoenix TV: Taiwanâs foreign affairs office said that Chinaâs reiterated groundless remarks in response to questions concerning the elections of Taiwan that âthe Taiwan question is Chinaâs internal affairsâ were not in line with the perception of the international community and the cross-Strait status quo. It called on the Chinese government to respect the results of the elections and face up to the reality. Whatâs your comment? Mao Ning: The elections of the Taiwan region belong to the affairs of a region in China. Whatever the results of the election, the basic fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China will not change; and the international communityâs prevailing consensus on upholding the one-China principle will not change. Both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China. Taiwan is part of Chinaâs territory. The Cairo Declaration issued by China, the US and the UK 80 years ago stipulates clearly that all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese, such as Taiwan, shall be restored to China. Article 8 of the Potsdam Proclamation jointly published by China, the US, the UK and the Soviet Union in 1945 stipulates that the terms of the Cairo Declaration shall be carried out. Later Japan accepted the Potsdam Proclamation and announced unconditional surrender. These legally binding international instruments provide the historical and jurisprudential basis for the fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinaâs territory. Although the two sides across the Taiwan Strait have yet to be reunified, the sovereignty and territory of China has never been severed and the legal status and fact that Taiwan is part of Chinaâs territory have never changed. This is the real status quo of the Taiwan question. China will achieve national reunification and Taiwan will inevitably return to the embrace of the motherland.  NHK: Why did the government of Nauru announce the decision to cut diplomatic relations with the Taiwan authorities after the elections in Taiwan? Mao Ning: The government of Nauru announced that it recognizes the one-China principle, breaks the so-called âdiplomatic tiesâ with the Taiwan authorities and seeks to reestablish diplomatic ties with China. This is a choice made independently by Nauru as a sovereign country. It shows that the one-China principle is where global opinion trends and where the arc of history bends. China News Service: According to media reports in Taiwan, the US, Japan and several European countries said that they plan to send delegations to the Taiwan region to âexpress congratulationsâ following the elections. Whatâs the Foreign Ministryâs comment? Mao Ning: The elections of the Taiwan region are Chinaâs internal affairs. Regardless of the result, the basic fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China will not be changed. The one-China principle is the political premise on which China establishes and develops diplomatic relations with other countries, a universally recognized basic norm in international relations and a prevailing consensus among the international community. Anyone in the international community who violates the one-China principle is interfering in Chinaâs internal affairs and infringing upon Chinaâs sovereignty, and will face the joint opposition of the Chinese people and the international community. China deplores and strongly opposes relevant countriesâ wrong practices violating the one-China principle, including issuing statements and âexpressing congratulationsâ. Weâve lodged serious dÃ©marches. I noted that following the elections in the Taiwan region, many countries and international organizations have publicly reiterated their commitment to the one-China principle, expressed opposition to âTaiwan independenceâ in any form and supported Chinaâs reunification. This is the voice of justice and peace from the international community. We believe that the international community will continue to adhere to the one-China principle, and support the Chinese peopleâs just cause of opposing âTaiwan independenceâ separatism and striving to achieve national reunification.â Global Times: On January 14, in response to media queries on the elections in the Taiwan region, the Singaporean Foreign Ministry spokesperson âwelcomedâ and âcongratulatedâ the elections. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: China has immediately made solemn dÃ©marches to Singapore. Singaporean leaders stated on multiple occasions that the Taiwan question is âa deep red lineâ for China. China values this statement and hopes that Singapore will strictly abide by the one-China principle and uphold the overall friendly relations between China and Singapore with concrete actions.  Dragon TV: Itâs reported that Ghanaâs Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta said in an interview on January 11 that Ghana has received a draft term sheet on debt relief from its official creditors that is sufficient for the International Monetary Fund to disburse USD 600 million to it. Could you brief us on the latest development? Mao Ning: China attaches great importance to Ghanaâs debt issue and has played an active coordinating role since the establishment of the Creditor Committee. Recently, China has called upon all parties to overcome technical difficulties and bridge differences, and finally led all parties in the Committee to basically agree on Ghanaâs debt treatment proposal at the fourth meeting of the Committee on January 8. Some of the Committee members are going through internal procedures in sync. The Chinese side will keep in close contact with all parties and continue to play a positive role in the settlement of Ghanaâs debt issue. News 1 Korea: The DPRK announced that it successfully test-fired an intermediate-range solid-fuel ballistic missile carrying a hypersonic warhead on January 14. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: We noted the reports. All parties need to face the crux of the Korean Peninsula issues squarely, advance the political settlement of the issues through dialogue and consultation and safeguard peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. The Paper: It is learned that former Vice Foreign Minister and former Under-Secretary-General of the UN Liu Zhenmin has succeeded Xie Zhenhua as Chinaâs special envoy for climate change. Can you confirm this and share more information? Mao Ning: As was decided by the Chinese government, former Vice Foreign Minister and former Under-Secretary-General of the UN Liu Zhenmin succeeded Xie Zhenhua as Chinaâs special envoy for climate change. Mr. Xie Zhenhua, while serving as the special envoy, made important contribution to China-US cooperation on climate change and global green and low-carbon development, and has won wide recognition from the international community. Special envoy Liu Zhenmin is a senior diplomat. He took part in multilateral negotiations on climate change as the head and major member of the Chinese delegation multiple times and, while serving as Under-Secretary-General for the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, presided over the work in areas of climate change and sustainable development. We believe that in his new post, special envoy Liu Zhenmin will continue stepping up dialogue and cooperation with all parties and contributing to the global transition to green and low-carbon development and the building of a community of life for humanity and nature. Reuters: A Taiwan official just said that China has lured Nauru with monetary support. May we know how much money is China going to give Nauru? Mao Ning: As a sovereign country, the Republic of Nauru independently made the right choice to announce that it recognizes the one-China principle, breaks the so-called âdiplomatic tiesâ with the Taiwan authorities and seeks to reestablish diplomatic ties with China. This fully shows that the one-China principle is where global opinion trends and where the arc of history bends.  Reuters: Ukraine has said over the weekend that China needs to be involved in talks for peace. Has Ukraine asked China to be involved in talks with Russia to end the Ukraine war? And has Ukraine requested for a meeting between President Zelenskyy and Premier Li Qiang in Davos? Mao Ning: Chinaâs position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear, which is centered on promoting talks for peace. Since the full escalation of the Ukraine crisis, China has been keeping in touch with relevant parties, including Ukraine. We will continue to work with the international community to play a constructive role for the political settlement of the crisis and we welcome and support all efforts conducive to realizing peace. On the talks that you mentioned, I have no information to offer. Beijing Youth Daily: Yesterday marks the 100th day of the outbreak of the latest Palestinian-Israeli conflict. During his visit to Egypt, Foreign Minister Wang Yi exchanged opinions with the Egyptian side on the Palestinian-Israeli situation. During his visit, China-Egypt Joint Statement on the Palestinian Issue and Joint Statement on the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict Between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Peopleâs Republic of China and the Secretariat of the League of Arab States were issued. Could you further share with us Chinaâs views on the situation in Gaza? What measures will China take to advance a comprehensive, just and sustainable settlement of the Palestinian issue? Mao Ning: China is gravely concerned that the escalating conflict in Gaza causes massive casualties of innocent civilians, a severe humanitarian disaster and expediting negative spillover effects. Since the outbreak of the latest Palestinian-Israeli conflict, China has all long stood on the side of equity and justice and done our best to realize a ceasefire, restore peace and protect civilians. As stressed by Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Egypt, ceasefire is the prevailing priority, humanitarian aid is the imperative moral responsibility, the future arrangement of Gaza must fully respect Palestiniansâ aspiration, and the two-state solution is the sure path to a just settlement of the Palestinian issue. China will continue to take an impartial stance, play its role as a major responsible country, and relentlessly work with the international community for a comprehensive, just and sustainable settlement of the Palestinian issue at an early date. Reuters: Chinaâs Foreign Minister Wang Yi has again called for a larger-scale, more authoritative and more effective international peace conference to end this Gaza crisis. Where should this conference be held and who should host it? Would it be in China? Mao Ning: China calls for the convening at an early date of an international peace conference with extensive participation to display international authority, promote the formulation of a binding roadmap, implement the two-state solution and, on this basis, advance the resumption of peace talks between Palestine and Israel and work for the peaceful co-existence between the two countries, so as to realize the comprehensive, just and sustainable settlement of the Palestinian question and bring security and peace to the people of the region. As to when and where to host the conference and who will host it, this needs to be decided through consultation by all parties. China welcomes the UN to play a positive role in this. Reuters: The Wall Street Journal reported that China has asked the countryâs airlines to conduct precautionary safety inspections on the Boeing 737 MAX fleets after the Alaska Airlineâs incident with the MAX 9. The newspaper has also said that Beijing is holding off from making further substantive moves as it waits for more clarity from US investigations into the accident. Would the ministry have any comment on this?â Mao Ning: Iâd refer you to competent authorities. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on January 12, 2024"," President Xi Jinpingâs Special Representative, Member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and Vice Premier of the State Council Liu Guozhong will attend the 19th Non-Aligned Movement Summit and the Third South Summit in Uganda and visit Algeria, Cameroon and Tanzania upon invitation from January 15 to 24. China News Service: To follow up on your announcement of the trip of Special Representative of President Xi Jinping and Vice Premier of the State Council Liu Guozhong, can you share more details? Mao Ning: The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) is a platform that brings developing countries together for seeking strength and opposing imperialism, hegemony and colonialism. The South Summit is the highest-level meeting of G77 and an influential international meeting in South-South cooperation. President of Uganda Yoweri Kaguta Museveni has sent several letters to invite President Xi Jinping to the 19th NAM Summit and the third South Summit. China, as the biggest developing country, is a natural partner of NAM and member of the Global South. For greater solidarity and cooperation among developing countries, Vice Premier Liu Guozhong will attend the two Summits as the Special Representative of President Xi Jinping. China and Africa belong to a community with a shared future. Algeria, Cameroon and Tanzania are important countries in Africa. China stands ready to take this visit as an opportunity to work with the rest of the vast developing world, including African countries, to advance the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative, champion an equal and orderly multipolar world and a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, strive toward building a community with a shared future for mankind, and write a new chapter of developing countries upholding independence and seeking strength through solidarity. CCTV: Itâs reported that President Xi Jinping has recently replied to a letter from Ms. Sarah Lande, a friend from Iowa of the United States. In 1985, Xi Jinping, then Party Secretary of Zhengding County in Hebei Province, led a delegation to visit Iowa and Ms. Lande was one of the organizers of this visit. Could you share with us more about the reply? Mao Ning: As you described, the letter is part of the story about a friendship that has lasted nearly 40 years. Back in 2022, President Xi also replied to a letter from Ms. Sarah Lande. He recalled his two trips to Iowa and stressed that the Chinese and American people are both great people and our friendship is a valuable asset and an important foundation for bilateral relations. Last November, President Xi addressed the welcome dinner by friendly organizations in the US. Ms. Lande attended the dinner as an invited guest. In her latest letter to President Xi, she said President Xiâs remarks at the dinner were welcomed by all with springing hope, and she was excited for the plan to invite 50,000 young Americans to China on exchange and study programs in the next five years. She hoped the two countries will work together to address critical issues of the day for the common humanity of the world.â On January 4, President Xi replied to her letter. He stressed that the achievements made by the two countries are attributable, first and foremost, to the common efforts of people in both countries, and the further growth of the relationship cannot do without the contribution of the two peoples. He mentioned that the future of the China-US relationship depends on the youth, and he launched the program of inviting young Americans to China in the hope that more young people from the US could visit China, see the country with their own eyes, listen with their own ears, travel the expanse of the country with their own feet, and build more bridges of mutual understanding and amity between the two peoples.â This year marks the 45th anniversary of China-US diplomatic ties. Over the past 45 years, it is the reaching out to each other by our peoples that has time and again brought China-US relations from a low ebb back onto the right track and made it possible for the relationship to move forward despite the many storms it has experienced. As stressed by President Xi in his reply, the future of our planet requires us to stabilize and improve the China-US relationship, and China is ready to work with the US to promote stable, healthy and sustainable development of China-US relations. Global Times: Itâs reported that with Chinaâs facilitation, Myanmar military held a new round of peace talks with ethnic armed groups in northern Myanmar, namely the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Taâang National Liberation Army and the Arakan Army, in Kunming. Can you brief us on the peace talks? Mao Ning: From January 10 to 11, with Chinaâs mediation and effort to drive progress, representatives of the Myanmar military and the three ethnic armed groups in northern Myanmar, namely the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Taâang National Liberation Army and the Arakan Army, held peace talks and officially reached a ceasefire agreement in Kunming of Chinaâs Yunnan Province. The two sides agreed to implement the ceasefire immediately, the military personnel will disengage and the two sides will address relevant disputes and concerns through peaceful negotiation. The two sides promised not to undermine the safety of Chinese people living in the border area and Chinese projects and personnel in Myanmar. The two sides had consultations on ceasefire arrangement and other matters. Maintaining the momentum of ceasefire and peace talks in northern Myanmar serves the interests of all parties in Myanmar and is conducive to keeping the China-Myanmar border area peaceful and stable. China hopes that relevant parties in Myanmar will earnestly implement the already reached ceasefire agreement, exercise maximum restraint toward each other, continue to address the issues through dialogue and consultation and together strive for progress in the peace process in northern Myanmar. China stands ready to continue to provide support and assistance to the best of our capability and play a constructive role to this end.  RIA Novosti: The Pentagon published its National Defense Industrial Strategy Report on Thursday, in which it proposed collaborating with countries in the Indo-Pacific to build up a strong defense industrial base and production capability to prepare for any potential future conflict in the region using the global experience of the Ukraine conflict. An effort to strengthen cooperation between the United States and its allies in the Indo-Pacific region should not âwait for emergency circumstances,â the report said. Whatâs Chinaâs comment on this? Mao Ning: As the worldâs No.1 military power with the highest military expenditure, the US lacks not in the capacity to launch wars, but the capacity to make and uphold peace. Peace and development is the shared pursuit of Asia-Pacific countries. The US needs to respect the call of countries in the region, do more things that are conducive to peace and stability, and refrain from introducing bloc confrontation, conflict and turmoil to the Asia-Pacific. CRI: Recently the National Security Council of the White House held a press call on Taiwan elections via teleconference. An anonymous official from the White House said that the US is committed to the one-China policy, does not support âTaiwan independenceâ and supports cross-Strait dialogue. The official added that the US does not take a position on the ultimate resolution of cross-Strait differences, provided they are resolved peacefully. What is your comment on this? Mao Ning: We noted the remarks of the US official. The one-China principle is a prevailing international consensus and the political foundation of the China-US relationship. âTaiwan independenceâ is the biggest threat to cross-Strait peace and stability and is doomed to failure. US leaders have repeatedly said that they are committed to the one-China policy, do not support âTaiwan independenceâ, do not support âtwo Chinasâ or âone China, one Taiwanâ, and do not seek to use the Taiwan question as a tool to contain China. We hope the US will honor these commitments, handle Taiwan-related issues prudently and properly, stop official interactions with Taiwan, stop sending wrong signals to âTaiwan independenceâ separatist forces, and refrain from interfering in the elections of the Taiwan region in any form. If the US truly hopes to safeguard peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, it needs to explicitly oppose âTaiwan independenceâ and support Chinaâs peaceful reunification. NTV: Regarding the election that is going to be held tomorrow, I understand that they have been reiterating that the Taiwan election is a domestic matter, but how do you think that the result of the election will affect the relationship between China and Taiwan? Mao Ning: The elections of the Taiwan region are Chinaâs internal affairs. Regardless of the result, it will not change the basic fact that Taiwan is part of China and there is only one China in the world. Bloomberg: On the question of Myanmar, will you be releasing any further statements or any more details about the ceasefire agreement that has been reached? Mao Ning: I have talked about the peace talks between the Myanmar military and ethnic armed groups in northern Myanmar held in Kunming. I have no additional information to offer. Kyodo News: After the Chinese media covered the food poisoning in Fukushima, this topic immediately became a top trending search on Weibo. Although Fukushima clearly stated that it were parasites that caused the poisoning, it was not reported by some Chinese media outlets. Many on Weibo linked the event to Japanâs discharge of ânuclear treated waterâ. Whatâs your comment? Mao Ning: I will not comment on whatâs been said on the Internet. On Fukushimaâs discharge of nuclear-contaminated water, Chinaâs position has always been very clear. Kyodo News: When Chinese and Japanese leaders met in November last year, they discussed holding expert consultations on the ocean discharge of the âtreated waterâ from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Has the agenda of the meeting been decided? Mao Ning: I have nothing to provide at the moment.  Beijing Daily: We noted that the latest tariff adjustment plan for 2024 announced by China applies provisional import tariff rates lower than the most-favored-nation rates to 1,010 goods and zero tariffs to some products. Given the sluggish global trade, whatâs the consideration behind Chinaâs tariff adjustments? Mao Ning: China announced and implemented the tariff adjustment plan for 2024 and is actively advancing free trade by optimizing the environment for foreign trade. It demonstrates Chinaâs sense of responsibility as a major country in sharing development dividends with all countries. Since its accession to the WTO, China not only fulfilled its entry commitments but also reduced its overall tariff rate to 7.3 percent in 2023. China has steadily increased its level of trade liberalization and openness. Despite risks and challenges brought by rising trade protectionism and unilateralism, China will stay committed to high-level opening up, advocate a universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization and work with all sides to uphold free trade and the multilateral trade system and energize global economic growth. AFP: The US launched an attack last night on Houthis in Yemen in retaliation to attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. Whatâs Chinaâs position on this issue? And does China support this operation?â Mao Ning: China is concerned about the escalating tension in the Red Sea and calls on relevant parties to exercise calm and restraint to prevent the conflict from escalating. The Red Sea is an important artery for global trade in goods and energy. China calls on relevant parties to play a constructive and responsible role in keeping the Red Sea safe and stable, which serves the common interests of the international community. Bloomberg: Today the Customs Administration of China said that the Red Sea problem is an issue for Chinese trade this year, and is one of the risk factors for the economy. The actions by the US and the UK may make passage of the Red Sea easier and thus benefit Chinese commerce. Do you think that on balance these actions are good for the Chinese economy and that it will make trade with Europe safer? Mao Ning: The Red Sea is an important international trade route. We believe it is important to ensure the safety of international sea lanes. We do not want to see tensions escalate in the Red Sea, for it will not be good for the worldâs economy and trade.  Bloomberg: Itâs reported yesterday a number of Chinese vessels in the Red Sea are broadcasting on their AIS transponders that they are Chinese. The AIS transponders, which generally say the destination and the cargo, are now saying we are Chinese ship. Do you have any information about this? And is this something the government has told Chinese vessels to do or is this something that the companies themselves are deciding to do? Mao Ning: I noted relevant reports but have no specific information. I think it to some extent shows the importance of deescalating the situation in the Red Sea and keeping international shipping lanes safe. Bloomberg: Has the Chinese government been in touch with the Iranian government or with the Houthis in Yemen directly to discuss the situation of the Red Sea since the attacks this morning? Mao Ning: I have no information to offer. Weâre ready to work with parties to deescalate the situation and keep international shipping lanes safe. Reuters: US think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), has said in a report that Chinaâs scientific research vessels that have engaged in oil and gas, and marine environmental surveys in the Indian Ocean could be supporting Chinaâs âmilitary needsâ. The report said Chinese submarines could be called on to support a wide range of missions, ranging from intelligence collection to nuclear deterrence patrols. We would like to seek the Ministryâs comment on that report. Could the Ministry offer any information on whether these research vessels and the expeditions are in any way related to military support? Does Chinaâs military obtain research data from these expeditions? Mao Ning: I donât see what the report is based on or how it reached those conclusions. What I can tell you is that Chinaâs scientific marine surveys are conducted in full compliance with the UNCLOS and have contributed to research on ocean science. We hope relevant parties will view Chinaâs scientific surveys as they are and not through tainted spectacles. Bloomberg: The Chinese military has a naval base near the Red Sea in Djibouti. Did the US or the UK provide advanced warning to the Chinese navy in the area about the attacks that took place in the Red Sea this morning in the interest of safety? Mao Ning: I do not have that information. Iâd refer you to Chinaâs competent authorities."
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on January 11, 2024"," At the invitation of Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum Klaus Schwab, President of the Swiss Confederation Viola Amherd, and Taoiseach of Ireland Leo Varadkar, Premier Li Qiang of the State Council will attend the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024 and pay an official visit to Switzerland and Ireland from January 14 to 17. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Yi will visit Egypt, Tunisia, Togo and CÃ´te dâIvoire at their invitation from January 13 to 18. This is the 34th consecutive year that Africa has been the destination of Chinese foreign ministersâ annual first overseas visit. Foreign Minister Wang Yi will then go on to visit Brazil and Jamaica at their invitation from January 18 to 22. Xinhua News Agency: You just announced that Premier Li Qiang will be attending the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2024. Can you share with us more details on his program and Chinaâs hopes for the meeting in Davos? Mao Ning: Premier Li Qiang will attend the opening plenary of the annual meeting. As one of the world leaders invited to the occasion, he will deliver a special address. The theme of this yearâs annual meeting is âRebuilding Trustâ. In a world fraught with uncertainties and struggling to find drivers for growth, we look to increase exchanges and communication and enhance mutual understanding and trust with other parties to the forum to contribute our part to better global economic recovery and governance and joint response to challenges. China Daily: Can you brief us on the program of Premier Li Qiangâs visit to Switzerland and Ireland? Whatâs Chinaâs expectation for the visit and how does China view its relations with Switzerland and Ireland? Mao Ning: During Premier Li Qiangâs visit to Switzerland, he will hold talks with President Viola Amherd of the Swiss Confederation and other members of the Federal Council to exchange views on China-Switzerland relations, mutually beneficial cooperation in various fields and international and regional issues. In the past 74 years since China and Switzerland established diplomatic ties, our bilateral relations have enjoyed sound growth. Our two countries established innovative strategic partnership in 2016. In early 2017, President Xi Jinping paid a successful state visit to Switzerland. The two sides reached important common understandings on cooperation, providing strategic guidance for the growth of China-Switzerland relations. Bilateral cooperation in trade, finance, innovation, people-to-people and cultural exchanges and other fields is built on a strong foundation and enjoys enormous potential. Premier Li Qiangâs visit to Switzerland will kick off high-level exchanges between China and Europe in 2024. We hope that this visit will further drive the implementation of the important common understandings between the two countriesâ leaders, maintain close high-level exchanges, enhance political mutual trust, strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation, jointly support free trade and multilateralism to add new dimensions to the China-Switzerland innovative strategic partnership. This year marks the 45th anniversary of China-Ireland diplomatic relations. The China-Ireland strategic partnership for mutually beneficial cooperation has grown steadily, with frequent interactions at various levels and deepening cooperation in trade and investment, green development, culture, education and other fields. During Premier Liâs visit, the two sides will have in-depth communication over implementing the common understandings between the two countriesâ presidents, cementing political mutual trust and deepening cooperation in various sectors. China looks to work with Ireland for greater progress in China-Ireland relations and new contribution to the sound and steady growth of China-Europe relations. CCTV: What is the significance of Foreign Minister Wang Yiâs annual first visit to Africa this year? Whatâs the consideration for visiting Brazil and Jamaica after visiting Africa? What does China hope to achieve through this trip? Mao Ning: Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yiâs visit to four African countries will mark the 34th year for the Chinese foreign minister to make Africa his first overseas destination at the start of the year. At the China-Africa Leadersâ Dialogue last year, President Xi Jinping made three proposals to support Africaâs industrialization, agricultural modernization and talent development, which were well-received by Africa. This year, FOCAC will meet again. Egypt, Tunisia, Togo and CÃ´te dâIvoire are all Chinaâs friendly cooperation partners. The purpose of Foreign Minister Wang Yiâs visit is to implement the follow-ups of the China-Africa Leadersâ Dialogue, compare notes with the African side on the 2024 FOCAC, carry forward the traditional China-Africa friendship and consolidate the momentum of China-Africa solidarity and cooperation.â Brazil and Jamaica are Chinaâs important cooperation partners in Latin America and the Caribbean. We enjoy a deep traditional friendship and engage in fruitful cooperation in trade, people-to-people exchanges and other fields. We share identical or similar positions on many regional and international issues. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Brazil and the 5th anniversary of the China-Jamaica strategic partnership. We will take this opportunity to further cement the foundation of political mutual trust, deepen mutually beneficial and friendly cooperation across the board and enhance communication and coordination on major international and regional issues for sustained and substantive growth of Chinaâs relations with Brazil, Jamaica, and Latin America and the Caribbean as a whole.â  China Review News: Ethiopia and Somaliland signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU). It is reported that Ethiopia will give formal recognition to the Republic of Somaliland in the MOU, which raised controversy in the Horn of Africa. What is your comment on that? Mao Ning: China stands for upholding the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and supports countries in safeguarding sovereignty and territorial integrity. Somaliland is part of Somalia. China supports the Federal Government of Somalia in safeguarding national unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Meanwhile, we hope that regional countries will handle regional affairs well through dialogue and achieve common development by having friendly cooperation. AFP: Chinaâs Embassy in Papua New Guinea has lodged representations with the Papua government and warned its citizens there to take security precautions. Can the Foreign Ministry confirm were there any Chinese citizens been killed or injured in the violence there? And can you maybe speak a little bit more about the extensive damage to Chinese businesses and institutions as far as it is known? Mao Ning: On January 10, shops were looted and two Chinese nationals had minor injuries during the riots in the capital Port Moresby of Papua New Guinea. Upon learning the news, the Foreign Ministry directed the Chinese Embassy in Papua New Guinea to immediately activate the consular emergency response mechanism. The Embassy made strong dÃ©marches to the government of Papua New Guinea and asked for swift and effective measures to keep Chinese nationals and institutions safe in the affected areas. The Embassy has also been advising Chinese nationals through multiple channels on how to keep themselves safe. We would like to remind Chinese nationals in Papua New Guinea to closely follow the local security situation, stay away from the affected areas, take safety precautions, and stay safe. We advise Chinese nationals to contact the police immediately and our Embassy for help in case of emergencies, or they may dial the MFA Global Emergency Call Center for Consular Protection and Services. The MFA and the Chinese Embassy in Papua New Guinea will provide timely consular protection and assistance to Chinese citizens and institutions in the affected areas. Shenzhen TV: Bloomberg reported that China last year elevated the way it described ties with 17 countries and territories, most of them from the developing world. The article says that China seeks to rally the Global South; While Washington has built a diplomacy strategy dependent on coalitions of mostly rich allies, Beijing is doing the opposite, wooing developing countries that make up the majority of the worldâs population. What is your comment? Mao Ning: On fostering external relations with other countries, China respects all countries as equals. We believe that each and every country should have its place in the international system and can play its due role. The future of the world should be decided and made by all countries. In the just concluded 2023, China has deepened and expanded global partnerships featuring equality, openness and cooperation. China has had a growing network of friends, made more and more new friends, and strengthened ties with old ones. This is because China develops relations with countries on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. This also reflects Chinaâs enhanced internationalâinfluence and greater moral appeal. This is fundamentally different from certain countriesâ practice of forming exclusive circles and seeking selfish geopolitical interests. As a developing country, China is naturally a member of the Global South. China has invariably stood in solidarity with fellow developing countries through thick and thin and safeguarded the shared interests of developing countries. Chinaâs solidarity and cooperation with other developing countries is not about wooing or rivaling anyone, but about safeguarding world peace, promoting global development, and upholding international order. We will continue to put the development of China in the global context and aligns the interests of the Chinese people with the interests of people across the world. We will work with all countries to meet challenges and create a better and brighter future for the world.  AFP: The Taiwan Affairs Office has said the election candidate Lai Ching-te poses a severe danger to cross-Strait ties. We havenât noticed any similar comments regarding other election candidates, and in addition, the Taiwan Affairs Office also urged voters in Taiwan to make the correct choice. What candidate does the mainland want to see win the election? Do Chinaâs comments represent interference in Taiwanâs democratic processes?â Mao Ning: This question is not related to Chinaâs foreign affairs. Iâd refer you to the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council regarding your question.ââ Beijing Youth Daily: Itâs reported that Argentinaâs Foreign Minister Diana Mondino met with Miao-hung Hsie, representative of the âTaipei economic and cultural office in Argentinaâ, on December 26, 2023. Sources said that this marks the first time for Argentinaâs Foreign Minister to set aside the one-China principle and have âinter-governmentalâ relations with Taiwan. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: I noted relevant reports. Argentina has clarified to China that what you said is just hyping-up and reiterated that the government of Argentina values its relationship with China and will stay committed to the one-China principle. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Argentina also made clarifications to local media outlets. Iâd like to stress that Taiwan is part of China and upholding the one-China principle is widely held consensus of the international community. Over the past five decades and more since China and Argentina established diplomatic ties, successive Argentinian administrations have upheld the one-China principle. China stands ready to work with Argentina to deepen our political mutual trust and advance the steady growth of China-Argentina comprehensive strategic partnership. China News Service: Itâs reported that ROK President Yoon Suk-yeol has signed the appointment on October 10 which made Cho Tae-yul the new Foreign Minister. What is your comment? Did China send a congratulatory message? Mao Ning: China has noted the reports. Foreign Minister Wang Yi has sent Mr. Cho Tae-yul a congratulatory message. China and the ROK are each otherâs important close neighbors and strategic cooperative partners. Maintaining the sound and steady growth of bilateral relations is in the common interest of the two countries and this is the goal that requires constant efforts from both sides. We hope that Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul will make strong efforts towards this end. AFP: Can the Chinese side provide any more details of the agreement that it signed with the Maldives? And there were some deals signed yesterday, including on climate, agriculture and infrastructure. Could the Foreign Ministry give an idea of the total value of these deals? Mao Ning: We appreciate your interest in the Maldivian Presidentâs state visit to China. Weâve released the readout and I have no additional information to offer. Associated Press of Pakistan: In Pakistan, a large number of projects have been successfully completed under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Do you have any details to share with us here? Mao Ning: The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is an important pioneering project of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). With the concerted efforts of the two sides, the CPEC has achieved some early harvests in transport infrastructure, energy, Gwadar Port, and other areas, giving a strong boost to economic and social development and regional connectivity in Pakistan and providing important support for building an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era.â China stands ready to work with Pakistan to implement the common understandings between the leaders of the two countries. With a high-standard, people-centered and sustainable approach, we can jointly develop the CPEC for growth, better life, innovation, green development, and openness, upgrade it and better boost the two countriesâ development to the benefit of the two peoples.â  Reuters: I have two questions on the elections in Taiwan. First, US officials said yesterday that the White House will send an unofficial delegation to Taiwan after the elections. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Second, the US yesterday said that any interference in Taiwan elections should be opposed. Reports say this is a warning for China. Whatâs the Foreign Ministryâs response? Mao Ning: There is only one China in the world. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. China firmly opposes the US having any form of official contact with the Taiwan region. The US needs to earnestly abide by the one-China principle and stipulations of the three China-US joint communiquÃ©s, prudently and properly handle Taiwan-related issues, stop official contact with the Taiwan region and stop sending wrong signals to âTaiwan independenceâ separatist forces. The US must not interfere in the elections in the Taiwan region in any form, or do anything harmful to China-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. On your second question, the Taiwan question is Chinaâs internal affairs. Elections in the Taiwan region are purely Chinaâs internal affairs that brook no external interference. China deplores and strongly opposes the USâ unwarranted comments on Taiwanâs elections. I need to stress that the Taiwan question is at the very core of Chinaâs core interests and is the first red line that must not be crossed in China-US relations. We urge the US to abide by the one-China principle and stipulations of the three China-US joint communiquÃ©s, honor the commitment made by US leaders, stop interfering in elections in the Taiwan region in any form and stop sending wrong signals to âTaiwan independenceâ separatist forces. China will take resolute and strong measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and territorial integrity. Antara News: Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi in Manila said Indonesia was ready to work with other ASEAN members, including the Philippines to finalize a long-delayed Code of Conduct for the South China Sea. While for years, ASEAN and also China have been trying to set up a framework to negotiate the Code of Conduct, but the progress has been slow. How optimistic is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China for the new phase of the negotiations regarding the South China Sea? Mao Ning: China and ASEAN countries are working toward the adoption of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea (COC), which is an important measure in implementing the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC). The consultations on the COC are going smoothly. The second reading has been completed and the third reading has commenced. Parties have adopted guidelines to accelerate consultations on the COC. The issue of the South China Sea is highly complex and faces external interference. We hope ASEAN countries will work with us toward the set target and speed up consultations for the early adoption of the COC.â AFP: President Xi Jinping had a video meeting with the President of Finland Sauli NiinistÃ¶. The Finnish readout of the meeting said that the two sides discussed a gas pipeline in the Baltic Sea that Finland believes was damaged by a Chinese ship, but the Chinese readout didnât seem to contain that information. So can the Foreign Ministry please explain the discrepancy between the readouts and also provide further details about what has been said about the pipeline? Mao Ning: Weâve released the readout on President Xi Jinpingâs virtual meeting with the Finnish President. I have no additional information to offer. China attaches great importance to protecting the safety and security of undersea infrastructure. China maintains communication and cooperation with Finland and other parties concerned.â Bloomberg: The German Foreign Minister was quoted today saying that they were concerned about the situation in the South China Sea and theyâre committed to rules-based international order, pointing out Chinese actions, and the recent clashes between Chinese and Filipino vessels in the area. Do you have any comment on what she said? Mao Ning: Chinaâs position on the South China Sea issue is clear and consistent. We are committed to properly handling disputes through dialogue and consultation with countries concerned, and would like to work with ASEAN countries to safeguard peace and stability in the region. That being said, China will firmly safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. No non-regional country has the right to interfere in the maritime disputes between China and the Philippines. Bloomberg: The National Security Council spokesperson was quoted in the FT article, saying that thereâs a clear precedent for sending former senior officials to Taiwan after the election, that this is consistent with the US one-China policy and consistent with the status-quo, and that as its time is after the election, it means itâs not endorsing one candidate or another candidate. Do you reject the assertion that this is consistent with the status-quo? And do you think that even though there is a precedent for this meeting, it should not take place? Mao Ning: China firmly opposes the US having any form of official contact with the Taiwan region. We ask the US to earnestly abide by the one-China principle and stipulations of the three China-US joint communiquÃ©s and prudently and properly handle Taiwan-related issues. The US must not interfere in elections in the Taiwan region in any form, and it must not send wrong signals to âTaiwan independenceâ separatist forces in any form. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on January 10, 2024"," At the invitation of Premier Li Qiang of the State Council, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Belgium Alexander De Croo will pay an official visit to China from January 11 to 12. CCTV: The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)âs Constitutional Court announced the final result of the presidential election. Incumbent President FÃ©lix Tshisekedi won 73.47 percent of votes for a second term. Whatâs Chinaâs comment and expectation for the future development of China-DRC relations? Mao Ning: China noted the final presidential election results announced by the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)âs Constitutional Court. We respect the choice made by the people in the DRC and congratulate President FÃ©lix Tshisekedi on his re-election. We believe that under the leadership of President Tshisekedi, the DRC is headed toward greater achievement in national development and revitalization. China and the DRC are comprehensive strategic cooperative partners. China highly values its relations with the DRC and stands ready to work with the DRC to carry forward our traditional friendship and deepen exchanges and cooperation in Belt and Road cooperation and under the FOCAC framework to deliver more benefits for the two peoples. AFP: China successfully launched the Einstein probe satellite and sent it into orbit yesterday. And that launch appeared to trigger Taiwan authorities to issue an emergency alert, which caused quite a lot of concerns among the public in Taiwan. Did the Chinese side know in advance that the launch would trigger such an alert and was it a deliberate time to coincide with the last few days of Taiwan election campaign? Mao Ning: Itâs not related to Chinaâs foreign affairs. It is pretty clear what the DPP authorities is trying to do by misleading the public and sowing panic. NHK: Forty-seven countries released a joint statement on Tuesday by saying Russia launched North Korean ballistic missiles at Ukraine. The statement called on Russia and North Korea to immediately cease all activities that violate the UN Security Council resolutions. So whatâs your take on this statement? And is there any intention for China to join the statement as a permanent member of the UN Security Council? Mao Ning: On the Ukraine crisis, Chinaâs position has been consistent. We believe that dialogue and negotiation is the only viable way out of the crisis and hope parties will reach a ceasefire soon and jointly deescalate the situation.  Hubei Media Group: The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) has been in force for two years. Can you share with us what it has achieved and Chinaâs role in it? Mao Ning: The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) is a milestone in the integration of the Asia-Pacific and a vivid demonstration of regional countries sharing development opportunities. Since it entered into force two years ago, RCEP has greatly lowered the regional trade costs, strengthened industrial and supply chains and brought tangible benefits to its members.â As the largest economy in RCEP, China is committed to development through openness, and the high-quality implementation of RCEP. China is the first non-ASEAN member to ratify RCEP. We have made every effort to deliver on the commitments on market access and ease tariffs, contributing our part to regional trade and investment and economic growth. RCEP membersâ goods have entered China with lower trade costs and more convenient customs clearance. In the first 11 months of 2023, China imported from Thailand, Viet Nam and other RCEP members fresh durians worth RMB 46,61 billion, 1.7 times the amount for the entire year of 2021. We stand ready to work with all parties for all-round and high-quality implementation of RCEP to enable the worldâs largest free trade area to unleash more benefits for common development and prosperity among its members. AFP: I got a question about the situation in Ecuador. The Chinese Embassy there has said all its consular branches will suspend services to the public. Iâm wondering have any Chinese nationals been affected by the situation in Ecuador and other consular authorities providing any further assistance to Chinese nationals there or planning any evacuations? Mao Ning: With instructions from the Foreign Ministry, our Embassy and Consulate in Ecuador immediately activated the emergency consular protection mechanism. We are gathering information about the safety of Chinese nationals and institutions in Ecuador and we have reminded them through various channels to take safety precautions. So far, no Chinese deaths or injuries have been reported in Ecuador. The Foreign Ministry and our Embassy and Consulate in Ecuador will continue to closely follow the developments on the ground and provide timely consular protection and assistance to Chinese nationals.  Antara News: The International Court of Justice (ICG) will hold its first hearing in South Africa genocide case against Israel tomorrow. Will China, as one of the member of UN Security Council, support South Africaâs case in ICG? Mao Ning: We noted the case. China is saddened by the heavy civilian casualties caused by the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict. We oppose any action that violates the international law and urge parties to the conflict to earnestly implement relevant resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council and General Assembly, reach an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire and stop the collective punishment against the people of Gaza. AFP: The Non-Aligned Movement Summit and the G77 Summit are due to be held in Uganda next week. And Iâm wondering if the Chinese side is able to provide any details about whether any top leaders will attend those two summits? Mao Ning: Weâll release information in due course. Please check back for updates. Reuters: Has Ghanaâs official creditor committee reached an agreement on a proposal to restructure Ghana debt to them? And if so, does China expect Ghana to agree to the deal and when? Mao Ning: As the co-chair of the Creditor Committee for Ghana under the Common Framework for Debt Treatments beyond the DSSI, China has, since the establishment of the Creditor Committee, played an active coordinating role and worked constructively to facilitate the proper settlement of Ghanaâs debt issue. China will continue to play its leading and coordinating role as the chair and work with Ghana and all the other parties to reach a restructuring plan that is in line with the principle of joint actions and fair burden-sharing so that Ghanaâs debt issue will be successfully resolved.  The Paper: As violence and crimes are on the rise in Ecuador, President Daniel Noboa declared âa state of emergencyâ, âinternal armed conflictâ and other measures. The country is striving to resume social order, democracy and the rule of law as soon as possible. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: China supports the government of Ecuador in maintaining social stability and hopes that the country will restore order as soon as possible. We also hope that Ecuador will earnestly ensure the safety of Chinese people and institutions in Ecuador. Reuters: Taiwanâs de facto âAmbassador to the United Statesâ has met with the US House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday. Does China have any comment on this meeting? Mao Ning: There is only one China in the world. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. China firmly opposes the US having any form of official contact with the Taiwan region. The US needs to earnestly abide by the one-China principle and stipulations of the three China-US joint communiquÃ©s, prudently and properly handle Taiwan-related issues, stop official contact with the Taiwan region, stop sending wrong signals to âTaiwan independenceâ separatist forces and refrain from interfering in elections in the Taiwan region in any form. The DPP authoritiesâ attempt to solicit support from the US and other countries for âTaiwan independenceâ will not succeed. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on January 9, 2024"," CCTV: Bangladeshâs 12th parliamentary election was held on January 7. According to preliminary results announced by the election commission, the Awami League (AL) party won 223 out of 298 directly elected seats. Media say this means that the Awami League won a landslide victory in the election. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: China congratulates Bangladesh on holding a smooth general election as scheduled and we congratulate the Awami League on winning the election. As a friend and neighbor, China firmly supports Bangladesh in advancing its post-election political agenda in accordance with the law. We stand ready to work with the new Bangladesh government on the basis of mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit and non-interference in each otherâs internal affairs to carry forward our traditional friendship, deepen high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and strive for new progress in China-Bangladesh strategic partnership of cooperation. Dragon TV: Following the summit meeting in San Francisco, Chinese and US universities have had some friendly exchanges. The Peking University table tennis team visited the US and the table tennis delegation from the University of Virginia visited China. Would you like to comment on that? Mao Ning: Very recently, the Peking University table tennis team visited the US at its invitation and took part in the USATT Table Tennis Open Championships and an event held by the Chinese Embassy and Consulates in the US to mark the historic ping-pong diplomacy. The team played table tennis and interacted with US friends who were personally involved in ping-pong diplomacy, young students and the local people. The table tennis delegation from the University of Virginia visited China upon invitation and attended the China-US Youth Ping-Pong Exchange at Tsinghua University. The mutual visits added a new chapter to the stories of China-US friendship that began with ping-pong diplomacy and new impetus to people-to-people exchanges. The hope of the China-US relationship lies in the people, its foundation is in our societies, its future depends on the youth, and its vitality comes from exchanges at subnational levels. Fifty-three years ago, young table tennis players from China and the US kick-started the progress toward normalizing China-US relations in Beijing, hence the much told stories of âthe little ball being able to move the big ball.â The more people-to-people exchanges our two countries have, the greater the public support, prospects and dynamism for China-US relations will be. China stands ready to work with the US to deliver the important common understanding reached at the San Francisco summit meeting on promoting people-to-people exchanges, carry forward the spirit of ping-pong diplomacy and write new chapters of friendship between our two peoples.â  AFP: A US Navy service member was sentenced today to 27 months in prison for transmitting sensitive US military information to the Chinese government. Do you have any comment on this case?â Mao Ning: I do not have specific information on that. But I have noticed that the US intelligence chief declared that progress has been made in rebuilding the US spy networks in China. The US on the one hand keeps spreading disinformation on so-called âChinese spyingâ, and on the other hand tells the public about its large-scale intelligence activities targeting China. This in itself is quite revealing. China will take all measures necessary to safeguard national security. Bloomberg: The shipping company COSCO said that itâs gonna stop making shipments to Israel from next week because of the threat in the Red Sea. This has only been confirmed by Israeli sources so far and the company hasnât commented. Do you have confirmation of this? And do you have any comment on the inability of COSCO delivering to Israel? Mao Ning: I do not have specific information on that. You may ask the company concerned directly. More broadly, we support Chinese companies in having normal business engagement with all countries, including Israel.  Bloomberg: You said that China supports its companies in engaging in normal commercial activities. The Chinese Navy has a fleet, guess itâs operating off Djibouti and into the Red Sea. Will the Chinese Navy start to escort Chinese commercial vessels through the Red Sea so that companies like COSCO can continue to conduct normal commercial operations? Mao Ning: Iâd refer you to competent authorities. China stands ready to work with all parties to keep international shipping lanes safe. AFP: Elections will be held in the Taiwan region this Saturday. Lai Ching-te just now said that the Chinese mainland is resorting to all means to interfere with this election. Whatâs your comment? Mao Ning: Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinaâs territory. Elections in the Taiwan region are Chinaâs internal affairs. Questions on those elections are not related to Chinaâs foreign affairs. Iâd refer you to the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council regarding your question. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on January 8, 2024"," China News Service: The US State Department on January 6 released the Joint Statement on the Trilateral US-Japan-ROK Indo-Pacific Dialogue, expressing their concerns over Chinaâs maritime claims in the South China Sea and escalatory behavior, and saying that they will continue their trilateral maritime security and law enforcement cooperation in accordance with international law. The three countries also reaffirmed the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as indispensable to security and prosperity in the international community. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: China noted the US-Japan-ROK dialogue and their joint statement. We express serious concerns about the statementâs rhetoric on China. We firmly oppose relevant countriesâ attempt to cobble together exclusionary groupings in the name of cooperation, grossly interfere in Chinaâs internal affairs, attack and smear China and stoke confrontation and antagonism. The situation in the South China Sea is generally stable. China is committed to safeguarding our own territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, while properly managing differences with countries directly concerned through dialogue and consultation. Certain non-regional country has sought to flex muscles and incite confrontation in the South China Sea, which is not conducive to peace and stability in the region. I want to stress that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinaâs territory and the Taiwan question is entirely Chinaâs internal affairs that brooks no foreign interference. The key to keeping the Taiwan Strait peaceful and stable lies in upholding the one-China principle and firmly opposing separatist moves toward âTaiwan independenceâ. The Asia-Pacific is a pacesetter of peace and development, not a chessboard for geopolitical contests. We urge relevant parties to earnestly respect regional countriesâ effort for peace and stability, abandon the Cold War mentality, stop creating bloc confrontation and stop fueling tensions in the region. Reuters: Taiwanese officials said three Chinese balloons detected flying over the Taiwan Strait on Sunday threatened aviation safety. Can the Foreign Ministry offer assurance that Chinese balloons flying over the Taiwan Strait are not a threat to international civil aviation? Mao Ning: Iâm not aware of the specifics you mentioned and itâs not related to Chinaâs foreign affairs. CCTV: The US has been tightening control over chip export to China and strengthening curbs on Chinaâs semiconductor companies. Do you have any comment on this? Mao Ning: The US has been stepping up control over chip export to China and going after Chinaâs semiconductor industry in the name of national security. This is out-and-out economic bullying. The US semiconductor export controls against China amount to discriminatory practices that violate the most-favored-nation principle stipulated in Article 1 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Blacklisting Chinaâs telecom equipment companies and prohibiting Chinese-made telecom equipment from entering the US market in the name of protecting cyber security violate the principle of general elimination of quantitative restrictions stipulated in Article 11 of the GATT. The ban also contravenes stipulations in the Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement. Despite its rhetorical emphasis on international rules, the US habitually ignores and breaks existing rules. The US uses national security as a pretext to restrict chip export to China, but the measures it has taken clearly go beyond the realm of national security and have gravely hindered the normal trade of ordinary chips for civilian use. The Nvidia RTX 4090 is a consumer graphics card for video game enthusiasts. But the company has been forced to pull this product off the Chinese market due to US export controls. The US has been asking certain countries to join itself in curbing Chinese companies. This has nothing to do with security. This is pure economic coercion. All of the above shows that the US is going after Chinese chip industry neither for national security reasons nor as part of a legitimate competition. This is unilateral bullying without principles or bottom lines that essentially denies emerging markets and developing countries the right to a better life for their people. The US behavior is taking a serious toll on the stability of the global industrial and supply chains. It poisons the atmosphere for international cooperation and fuels division and confrontation. This selfish move will inevitably backfire.  Danish Broadcasting Corporation: The Queen of Denmark Margrethe II announced her abdication of the throne on New Yearâs Day. Sheâs set to give the position over to her son this week. Sheâs visited China quite a few times during the rein and met several Chinese leaders, including Xi Jinping. Does the Foreign Ministry have a comment on her abdication? Mao Ning: Her Majesty Queen Margrethe II of Denmark is the first western head of state to visit China after we began reform and opening up in 1978. She visited China twice in 1979 and 2014. She is an old friend of the Chinese people and made important contribution to China-Denmark relations and friendship. Our relationship with Denmark enjoys good momentum and we are ready to continue advancing our two countriesâ comprehensive strategic partnership together with the Royal House and the Danish people. AFP: According to the Ministry of State Security, Chinaâs national security authority uncovered an espionage case involving the UKâs Secret Intelligence Service and has taken criminal compulsory measures against the suspect surnamed Huang. Apart from what has been released by the Ministry of State Security, can you provide more information about the case? Does the Foreign Ministry have any additional comment? Mao Ning: You may refer to the information concerning the case released on the WeChat account of Chinaâs Ministry of State Security. I have no additional information to offer. Bloomberg: You just now had a long statement on how US export controls violate the principles of free trade in GATT. And you also said that the US is stretching national security. China has recently stopped the export of some kind of graphite or its licensing for national security reasons. Thereâs also been a ban on the export of some kinds of rare earth processing technologies and rare earth themselves. How is this different from what the US is doing in exporting US technology to China? Mao Ning: On the Chinese export controls you just mentioned, you can find the reasons behind these measures in previous statements and announcements released by Chinaâs competent authorities. Our measures do not target any particular country or company, which is fundamentally different from the measures deliberately imposed by the US to target particular countries and companies in the name of national security. You may ask the competent authorities for more information.â  AFP: The Ministry of Commerce announced an anti-dumping investigation into imported brandy originating from the EU. Is there a connection between this probe and the EUâs investigation into Chinese EVs? Mao Ning: I would like to refer you to Chinaâs competent authorities for your specific questions. More broadly, China is committed to high-standard opening up and the principles of market economy and the WTO rules. We are ready to provide an open, inclusive, transparent and non-discriminatory environment for EU and other international businesses that trade and invest in China. This has been our position all along and has not changed.ââ Ukrainian News Agency: On January 6, Russian military attacked residential buildings in Pokrovsky district of the Donetsk region and killed 11 civilians, including five children. Several countries in the United Nations, particularly Denise Brown, Assistant Secretary General, Permanent Coordinator of Humanitarian Affairs in Ukraine, condemned Russian strikes and expressed the condolences to the victimsâ family. Does China support this position of the UN regarding the condemnation of the killing of Ukrainian civilians by the Russian military? Mao Ning: Chinaâs position on the Ukraine crisis is consistent and clear. We call on relevant parties to exercise maximum restraint, refrain from attacking civilian facilities and protect civilians. China always believes that dialogue and negotiation are the only viable solution to the Ukraine crisis. We hope all parties will work for a political settlement of the crisis, reach a ceasefire soon and jointly deescalate the situation. Global Times: Al Jazeera released a statement on January 7 condemning Israel for killing its journalist Hamza Dahdouh during Israelâs attack against southeastern Gaza. Hamza is the son of Al Jazeeraâs Gaza bureau chief Wael Dahdouh whose wife, son, daughter and grandson were killed during a previous Israeli air strike. It was reported that Mustafa Thuria, a video stringer for AFP, was also killed during the attack. Whatâs your comment? Mao Ning: We mourn for the two journalistsâ death and extend our deep sympathies to Mr. Wael Dahdouh for his loss. During the past three months, the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict has taken nearly 23,000 lives in Gaza, including over 100 media workers. According to relevant UN agency, nearly 90 percent of people in Gaza have been displaced. Despite the repeated international call for ceasefire, the fighting is still raging and killing innocent civilians every day. China strongly calls on relevant parties to the conflict, especially Israel, to exercise restraint, faithfully implement relevant UN resolutions, start an immediate ceasefire, protect civilians and prevent such tragedies from reoccurring.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on January 5, 2024"," Reuters: The White House said on Thursday that North Korea recently provided Russia with ballistic missiles and launchers for use in Moscowâs war against Ukraine. Given that China is a member of the Security Council at the United Nations, what is its position on this weapons transfer in light of Chinaâs many calls for a ceasefire in Ukraine? Wang Wenbin: I do not know of the cooperation you mentioned. Chinaâs position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear. We hope all parties will work on ways for deescalation and create the conditions for working towards a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. AFP: The Democratic Peopleâs Republic of Korea (DPRK) fired artillery shells into waters off the western coast of the Republic of Korea (ROK) today. Residents of Baengnyeong island and Yeonpyeong island were ordered to evacuate. Is China for or against DPRKâs move? Wang Wenbin: We noted that the ROK and the US have recently conducted large-scale joint drills in the DPRK-ROK border region, and the DPRK conducted artillery drills this morning. We are following the developments on the Korean Peninsula closely. Recently, antagonism between relevant parties has risen, with tensions running high on the Peninsula. As a neighboring country, China stands for keeping the Peninsula peaceful and stable and resolving the issues of the Peninsula through dialogue and consultation. Under the current circumstances, we hope that relevant parties will exercise calm and restraint, refrain from fueling tensions and avoid further escalation to create conditions for the resumption of meaningful dialogue. Xinhua News Agency: China has announced Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzuâs state visit to China. Could you share with us the program and Chinaâs expectation for the visit? Wang Wenbin: This is President Mohamed Muizzuâs first state visit to a foreign country since he took office. President Xi Jinping will host a welcome ceremony and a welcome banquet for President Mohamed Muizzu. The two heads of state will hold talks and attend the signing ceremony of cooperation documents. Premier Li Qiang and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Peopleâs Congress Zhao Leji will meet with President Mohamed Muizzu respectively. China and the Maldives boast time-honored friendship. In the past 52 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties, the two countries have treated each other with respect and supported each other, setting a fine example of equality and mutual benefits between countries of different sizes. In 2014, President Xi Jinping paid a historic state visit to the Maldives. The two sides agreed to build a future-oriented all-around friendly and cooperative partnership. Over the past decade, the relations between China and the Maldives have deepened and achieved fruitful outcomes of practical cooperation in various fields, including Belt and Road cooperation, and deepening traditional friendship. The relations between China and the Maldives now stand at a new historical starting point. We believe that through this visit, the two heads of state will provide strategic guidance for the bilateral relations to reach a new height.  TRT: The Republic of South Africa filed a lawsuit in the International Court of Justice and requested an interim injunction on the ground that Israel violated the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide with the actions it committed in Gaza since October 7. TÃ¼rkiye also welcomes this application. Whatâs Chinaâs views regarding this application? Wang Wenbin: We noted the application. The ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict has killed more than 22,000 people in Gaza already, most of whom were civilians. The daily civilian death toll remains above one hundred. This must not continue. We oppose any action that violates the international law. We urge parties to the conflict to implement the resolutions adopted by the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly, carry out full ceasefire at once and stop the collective punishment against the people of Gaza.â AFP: I got a question on Donald Trump. A report by the Democrats in the US Congress was published yesterday. It claims that Chinese entities spent over USD 5.5 million at properties owned by Donald Trump. The report says that all that happened while Donald Trump was the US President. Is that true? Wang Wenbin: I do not know about those claims. We urge relevant US politicians to stop buzzing about China. CCTV: In a recent interview, Moiz Farooq, an executive editor of Daily Ittehad Media Group who visited Xinjiang of China along with a delegation of Pakistani media and think tanks last month, said that he saw the Muslims there enjoying happy lives and religious freedom and the so-called human rights atrocity in Xinjiang claimed by the US and some western countries cannot hold water. What is your comment?â Wang Wenbin: We noted relevant reports. Xinjiang is visited by more and more people from around the world these days, who would then share their trips. We prepared some slides about their experience. In 2023 alone, Xinjiang received nearly 400 delegations and groups that consist of over 4,300 visitors from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Japan, Egypt, France, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and other countries and international organizations. Some of them are government officials, diplomats, religious figures, experts, scholars, journalists and ordinary travelers. They visited many places there. They listened to clergies giving sermons at mosques and the Islamic institutes and visited cultural heritage sites to see how Xinjiangâs traditional culture is protected. They went to local factories, businesses and farms to learn about Xinjiangâs production and development, and visited ordinary households where they saw the happy life of people of various ethnic groups. Japanese tourists who traveled to Xinjiang said that they witnessed the happy life of Xinjiang people and began to know that many ethnic groups live side by side in the region and they are united like pomegranate seeds. A Pakistani journalist said that everywhere he went in Xinjiang, he could see people living a normal, peaceful and contented life, and what he saw in Xinjiang is different from the horrifying reports he had read about. Maxime Vivas, a French writer who visited Xinjiang for the third time last year, said that tranquility and harmony can be seen everywhere in the region. He questioned where the accusation of religious, language and cultural extinction came from and asked, âif the Chinese government were demolishing mosques and restricting the freedom of religious belief, then why have they trained over 3,000 clergies every year?â A French scholar said that using forced labor does not make sense in a country that owns 40 percent of the worldâs invention patents. Seeing is believing. People are not blind to the truth. For certain countries, they are comfortable telling lies about genocide and forced labor in Xinjiang, but it takes them forever to acknowledge the humanitarian tragedies in places such as Gaza. This is plain hypocrisy. Xinjiang will keep its door open to the world. We sincerely welcome more friends from all countries to visit Xinjiang and see its charm, harmony and prosperity for themselves. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on January 4, 2024"," Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting: On January 3, a terrorist attack killed nearly 100 people and wounded about 200 persons at the commemorating ceremony of General Qassem Soleimani in Kerman. Whatâs the comments of the Chinese government in this regard? Wang Wenbin: We are deeply shocked by the devastating terrorist attack in Iranâs southeastern province of Kerman which has inflicted heavy casualties. We express our deep condolences over the loss of lives and sincere sympathies to those who have been injured and the families of the victims. China opposes terrorism in any form and strongly condemns terrorist attacks. We firmly support Iran in safeguarding national security and stability. CCTV: In the just concluded 2023, the world economy emerged from COVID-19 and slowly recovered. China played an important role in keeping the Asia-Pacific and global economy growing. How will China contribute to global growth in 2024? Wang Wenbin: In 2023, Chinaâs economy sustained the momentum of recovery despite external pressure and achieved solid progress in high-quality development. Relevant internationalâinstitutions projected Chinaâs economic growth rate in 2023 to be around 5.2 percent, holding the lead among major economies and continuing to be the largest engine for global growth. China secured a bumper harvest for the 20th year in a row with the total grain output exceeding 0.65 trillion kilos for nine consecutive years, hitting another record high. Some media outlets estimated that China would surpass Japan for the first time to become the largest car exporter in 2023. During the recent New Year holiday, 135 million domestic trips were made, up by 9.4 percent on a comparable basis from the same period in 2019; and domestic tourism generated RMB 79.73 billion of revenue, up by 5.6 percent compared with the same period in 2019. As a mega market, China continues to unleash its vast potential of domestic demand. The fundamentals sustaining Chinaâs steady growth in the long run have not changed and the world has shown confidence in Chinaâs economy this year. IMF Senior Resident Representative in China predicted that the Chinese economy will maintain sound growth in 2024 and continue to account for one third of global economic growth. The Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that the fundamentals of Chinaâs economy in 2024 will be further cemented. Institutions such as the US Center for Strategic and International Studies believe that Chinaâs exports remain strong in electric vehicle batteries, electronic products and minerals and quite a few Chinese industries have become globally competitive. Several international media outlets commented that Chinaâs large economic size, mature industrial ecosystem and rising middle class mean it is a market hard to give up. In 2024, China will apply the new development philosophy on all fronts, speed up building the new development paradigm, promote high-quality development and continue to harness its strong innovation capacity, huge market, sound infrastructure, complete industrial chain and rich and high-quality human resources. China will expand high-level opening up, further ease market access, foster a world-class, market-oriented business environment governed by a sound legal framework, and share with the rest of the world new opportunities created by Chinese modernization. China will remain an important engine driving world economic growth. In a world battling economic uncertainties, China is a source of certainty and positive energy.  AFP: There were media reports yesterday that an artillery shell crossed from Myanmar into the Chinese town of Nansan in Yunnan Province where it exploded, causing injuries to multiple people. Can you provide any more details about this incident? Were there Chinese casualties?â Wang Wenbin: China follows closely the recentâconflict in northern Myanmar. We strongly deplore the Chinese casualties caused by the conflict, and have lodged serious dÃ©marches to relevant parties. China once again asks all parties to the conflict to reach immediate ceasefire, take concrete actions and stop any malicious incident that endangers the tranquility in the China-Myanmar border area and Chinese lives and property from happening again. China will take necessary measures to safeguard the lives and property of Chinese nationals. Global Times: Sartaj Aziz, former Financial Minister, Foreign Minister, and advisor to the Pakistani Prime Minister on national security and foreign affairs, passed away in Islamabad on January 2. He was very friendly to China. Does China have any comment on his passing?â Wang Wenbin: Mr. Aziz was a veteran statesman, strategist and economic expert and also a long-standing good friend of the Chinese people. He devoted himself abidingly to Pakistanâs prosperity. He spared no effort in advancing China-Pakistan relations and did so with great passion. He made outstanding contribution to China-Pakistan friendship and cooperation, especially the launch and development of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. We mourn Mr. Azizâs passing and would like to extend sincere sympathies to his family.ââ Reuters: Over 10 countries, including the US, Australia, Canada, Germany and Japan issued a joint statement yesterday to urge the Houthis to immediately halt their attack in the Red Sea. Why didnât China condemn the Houthis? Wang Wenbin: The Red Sea is an important international trade route for goods and energy. Keeping the region safe and stable serves the common interest of the international community. China stands for protecting the safety of international sea lanes and against causing disturbance to civilian ships. We believe all parties need to play a constructive and responsible role in keeping the shipping lanes safe in the Red Sea.  AFP: Chinese military said it has been conducting patrols in the South China Sea yesterday and today. This coincides with joint naval drills held by the United States and the Philippines. Could you describe the Chinese patrols such as their precise location and main goals? Wang Wenbin: The Southern Theater Command of the PLA has released relevant information. We would like to stress that the US and the Philippinesâ muscle-flexing, provocative military activities in the South China Sea are not conducive to managing the situation on the sea and handling maritime disputes. We urge relevant countries to stop the irresponsible moves, and respect regional countriesâ effort to uphold peace and stability in the South China Sea. China will continue to firmly safeguard our territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and make active efforts to uphold peace and tranquility in the region. China Review News: Itâs reported that recently when entering the US border, several Chinese students suffered from lengthy interrogation and their cellphones, computers and other electronic devices were inspected. Some of them saw their visas revoked and were given 5-year ban from entering the US. Whatâs your comment?â Wang Wenbin: The US has long been wantonly suppressing and ill-treating Chinese students traveling to the US with lawful and valid identifications and visas. Some of the students were interrogated, confined, forced into confession, induced and even deported without just cause. Every month for the past few months, the US deported dozens of Chinese arriving in the US, including students. This is a clear case of selective, discriminatory and politically motivated law enforcement. We strongly deplore and firmly oppose this. The US likes to portray itself as open, inclusive and a place for academic freedom, but it wrongly adopted Proclamation 10043 and put it into force, overstretched the concept of national security, politicized and weaponized academic research and repeatedly interrogated, harassed and deported Chinese students. Such behavior has seriously undermined the studentsâ lawful rights and interests and poisoned the atmosphere for China-US people-to-people exchanges. It goes against the two Presidentsâ agreement to promote and facilitate people-to-people exchanges and the two peoplesâ shared desire for more friendly exchanges. China urges the US to act on its commitment of welcoming Chinese students to study in the US, withdraw the unjust Proclamation 10043 and stop bullying and restricting Chinese students in the name of national security. The US needs to ensure the security and lawful rights and interests of Chinese students and scholars in the US and take concrete steps to support and facilitate people-to-people exchanges and cross-border travel between the two countries as it has promised. China will continue to take necessary measures to resolutely protect Chinese citizensâ lawful rights and interests. We also remind Chinese students traveling to the US to be mindful of such risks.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on January 3, 2024"," Beijing Daily: This year marks the 30th anniversary of Chinaâs entry into the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Can you brief us on Chinaâs effort to advance international cooperation on patentsâand global governance of intellectual property? Wang Wenbin: China attaches high importance to international patent cooperation and intellectual property (IP) protection. In the past three decades since China became a member of the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), weâve actively participated in the revision and improvement of PCT and other international rules, improved our own legal system on IP and engaged in productive cooperation with the World Intellectual Property Organization. China has been the top filer of international patent applications through PCT for four consecutive years, making itself one of the worldâs leading countries in the area of IP and innovation. IP protection serves as a major pillar for innovative development. Building on its rich reservoir of patent technologies, China has been enhancing the quality and efficiency of its work on IP to unleash creativity at a faster pace. So far, China has filed 126,400 global patent applications for solar panels, ranking the first in the world. Top 10 NEV makers in China by sales possess over 100,000 global patents in force, leading the green and low-carbon sector and providing a strong impetus for world economic recovery. China has expanded opening up in IP protection and fostered a world-class business environment that is market-oriented, law-based, and internationalized. More and more foreign applicants are looking to do business and plan their patent portfolios in China. Over the past decade or so, applicants from 115 Belt and Road partner countries filed applications for 253,000 patents in China, an annual increase of 5.4 percent. As of the end of 2022, a total of 861,000 invention patents were in force for overseas applicants in China, a year-on-year increase of 4.5 percent. This speaks to the foreign-funded companiesâ recognition towards Chinaâs effort in IP protection. Looking forward, China will continue to uphold the principle of openness, inclusiveness, balance and benefits for all, strengthen exchanges and cooperation on IP with all countries, and advance a fairer and more just global governance on IP to deliver more benefits of innovation to people around the world and build a community with a shared future for mankind.â Reuters: Has China sent any humanitarian aid to Japan since the earthquake on Monday? Or has Japan made any request to China for relief aid? Are there any latest updates on how the disaster is affecting Chinese nationals there?â Wang Wenbin: China expressed sympathies to the Japanese side yesterday over the powerful earthquakes that hit Noto region in Ishikawa Prefecture of Japan. We are willing to provide necessary help to Japan for its relief and rescue efforts. To my knowledge, no Chinese casualty has been reported so far. The Foreign Ministry and our embassy and consulates in Japan will continue to follow the situation closely and provide timely and necessary assistance to our nationals in Japan.  Rudaw Media Network: A project which two Chinese companies and the Iraqi government implement will build 30,000 residential housing units in Iraq. Why doesnât the project cover any governorate in the Kurdistan region? Wang Wenbin: China and Iraq have friendly relations. As a sincere friend of the Iraqi people, China has taken an active part in the economic reconstruction of Iraq and contributed to Iraqâs economic and social development, which is widely recognized by the Iraqi government and public. China stands ready to continue working with Iraq for new progress in practical cooperation in various areas. CCTV: It was reported that in an interview on January 2, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva warned against fragmentation of the global economy along geopolitical lines due to increasing national security restrictions, with countries gravitating towards separate blocs led by the United States and China. Allowed to continue, she said this could ultimately reduce global GDP by 7 percent. What is your comment? Wang Wenbin: We noted the reports. There is only one planet we call home and one common future for humanity. The international community needs to work together and support each other in response to current crises and for a better future. Whatâs needed most is solidarity, and what should be avoided most is fragmentation. Be it trade war, tech war, or decoupling, severing of industrial and supply chains and de-risking, they are all essentially designed to politicize trade issues and be used as weapons to perpetuate certain countryâs primacy, hold back emerging markets and developing countries in their development efforts, and deprive their 7 billion people of the right to a better life. This is neither virtuous nor sustainable. Ultimately, it is the overall interest of the international community that will take the toll and no single country can be spared. The world will not retrogress to a state of isolation and exclusiveness, still less can it be deliberately divided. Any beggar-thy-neighbor move, bloc confrontation mentality, and arrogant sense of supremacy are doomed to failure. China would like to work with all parties to champion universally beneficial and inclusive economic globalization, firmly reject de-globalization and overstretching of security concept, oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, uphold the equality of rights, opportunities and rules among all countries, protect the right of all countries to equal development and advance common development and prosperity. Reuters: We would like to ask the same about the Japan Airlinesâ airport accident yesterday. Has China sent any aid to Japan or any specific organizations there? Or has Japan also made any request for aid in that sense?â Wang Wenbin: We noted the reports. We express our condolences over the loss of lives in the accident and our sympathies to those who have been injured. According to what I have learned, Japan has not made requests for aid.â In the wake of the accident, the Chinese Embassy in Japan immediately contacted local government authorities and the airline for more information. No Chinese national was injured. There were 14 Hong Kong tourists on the plane. The Embassy has got in touch with them and is working to re-issue travel documents for those who have lost theirs. We will follow closely the latest developments and provide timely assistance to Chinese nationals. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on January 2, 2024"," CCTV: President Xi Jinpingâs new year address has received close attention from home and abroad. Many in the world believe that the address conveys Chinaâs confidence and strength in its development and shows the world a thriving, confident and open China. We noted that in his 2024 new year address, President Xi Jinping stressed that China âwill work closely with the international community for the common good of humanity, build a community with a shared future for mankind, and make the world a better place for all.â What efforts will China make through its diplomacy to advance this cause in 2024? Wang Wenbin: In his new year address delivered on the eve of the new year, President Xi Jinping reviewed Chinaâs remarkable achievements in 2023 and presented a bright outlook of the Chinese people continuing to forge ahead with resolve and tenacity for their dreams in 2024. He also expressed Chinaâs sincere wish to work together with other countries for a future that belongs to all. It was truly uplifting and inspiring. The year 2023 that has just passed witnessed Chinaâs sense of responsibility as a major country to bring stability and certainty to a turbulent world filled with uncertainties. In 2023, China successfully held the China-Central Asia Summit, the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, the Chengdu Summer Universiade and the Hangzhou Asian Games to promote peace and development as the underlying trend of the international landscape and deliver cooperation for mutual benefit with the rest of the world. President Xi paid four overseas visits and attended a number of international conferences where he met with friends, both old and new, with whom he shared Chinaâs vision, enhanced common understandings and conveyed Chinaâs confidence in working with the world to meet challenges and overcome difficulties. The world saw more clearly that China is not only committed to its own development, but also actively embracing the world. This year, we will celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Peopleâs Republic of China. On the new journey ahead, we will be guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era and Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy in particular and always bear in mind the goals and tasks for Chinese modernization. We will stay confident, stand on our own feet, promote openness and inclusiveness, uphold fairness and justice and pursue cooperation for mutual benefit. We will focus on building a community with a shared future for mankind, step up to our historical responsibility and work with a greater innovative spirit to open up new prospects in our major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, bring countries together to meet challenges and achieve prosperity for all, and usher in a bright future of peace, security, prosperity and progress for our world. AFP: The Thai Prime Minister has reportedly said today that Thailand and China will cancel certain visa requirements for each otherâs citizens in March this year. Can you confirm this? And if so, could you please provide more detail about the types of visas that will be waived under this new policy? Wang Wenbin: To further enhance people-to-people exchanges and mutually exempt visas between China and Thailand serves the fundamental interests of both peoples. The government departments responsible for the matter are in close communication on the specifics. We look forward to the early implementation of the arrangement.  China Daily: It was reported that the first meeting of the sub-committee on China-Uzbekistan poverty reduction cooperation was held via video link on December 29, 2023, where new consensus was reached on deepening cooperation on poverty reduction in the next stage. What is Chinaâs comment? Wang Wenbin: As agreed between the heads of state of the two countries, China and Uzbekistan set up a sub-committee on poverty reduction cooperation under the framework of the intergovernmental cooperation committee during the China-Central Asia Summit last May. This is the first sub-committee on poverty reduction that China established with other countries at the governmental level. The success of the first meeting of the sub-committee marks the official launch of the China-Uzbekistan poverty reduction cooperation mechanism and opens a new chapter of poverty reduction cooperation between the two countries. Poverty is a scourge for humanity and a common challenge facing the whole world. The Chinese government always puts rural development and poverty reduction as a priority of the governance of the country. We have pooled resources to win the battle against poverty and hit the targets of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule. At the moment, China is advancing the cause towards a strong and prosperous country and national rejuvenation in all respects through Chinese modernization. As a Chinese saying goes, âA single flower does not make spring, while one hundred flowers in full blossom bring spring to the garden.â Only development for all is true development. China stands ready to work with all countries to realize modernization of the world featuring peaceful development, mutually beneficial cooperation and common prosperity and build a community with a shared future for mankind.â China News Service: It was reported that on January 1, powerful earthquakes hit Noto region in Ishikawa Prefecture of Japan and triggered a tsunami. By the morning of January 2, the earthquake has left over 20 dead and Ishikawa Prefecture and several other regions badly stricken. Has China extended sympathies to Japan? Any measures taken by China to protect Chinese nationals there? Wang Wenbin: Yesterday, powerful earthquakes hit Noto region in Ishikawa Prefecture of Japan, causing casualties and damage of property. We express our condolences over the loss of lives and our sympathies to the families who have lost loved ones and those who have been injured. The Chinese Embassy in Japan and Consulates-General in Nagoya and Niigata immediately activated the emergency response mechanism and issued consular notices. So far, there have been no reports of Chinese casualties. The Foreign Ministry and our embassy and consulates in Japan will continue to follow the situation closely and provide timely and necessary assistance to our nationals in Japan. Bloomberg: Itâs been reported that the US asked Dutch company ASML to hold shipments of lithography machines to China in advance of a ban that will be implemented later this month. Does the foreign ministry have any commentï¼ Wang Wenbin: We noted relevant reports. China opposes the USâs overstretching the national security concept and using all sorts of pretexts to coerce other countries into joining its technological blockade against China.â Semiconductor is a highly globalized industry. In a deeply integrated world economy, the USâs hegemonic and bullying practices seriously violate international trade rules, undermine the global semiconductor industry structure, impact the security and stability of the international industrial and supply chains, and will surely boomerang. We urge the Dutch side to uphold an objective and fair position and market principles, respect the spirit of contract, take concrete actions to protect the shared interests of China and the Netherlands and the companies of the two countries, and safeguard the stability of the international industrial and supply chains and the free, open, fair and non-discriminatory international trade environment. China will closely follow relevant developments and resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.  China Review News: Recently, countries including the UK and the US issued a statement in the name of âMedia Freedom Coalition (MFC)â, arguing that the Central Government and HKSAR Government suppressed the press with the National Security Law and urging China to âabide by the international human rights commitments and legal obligationsâ. Whatâs your comment? Wang Wenbin: This is a smear against press freedom in Hong Kong, an attack on the HKSAR Governmentâs legitimate law enforcement and a move to embolden those who are anti-China and engaged in destabilizing Hong Kong such as Jimmy Lai. China deplores and firmly rejects this so-called statement from a handful of countries in the name of âMedia Freedom Coalitionâ. The cases of Julian Assange and Edward Snowden have already shown the world that the so-called âfreedom of pressâ is just a tool some countries use to attack and smear others. These countries care little about the freedom of press when their selfish interests are involved. They made irresponsible remarks on matters concerning Hong Kong in the name of freedom of press only because they are not happy that Hong Kong is prospering and they still hope to keep their past privileges and influence in Hong Kong but to no avail. Hong Kong follows the rule of law. All laws in Hong Kong must be observed and those who break the law must be held accountable. Since the national security law entered into effect in Hong Kong, Hong Kong has restored order and is set to thrive. The rule of law has been upheld and justice served. The lawful rights and freedoms including the freedom of press and freedom of speech of Hong Kong residents have been protected in a safe and stable environment under the rule of law. The number of international media outlets and journalists in Hong Kong has increased from before the national security law was introduced. This is a fact that could not be denied by any unbiased person. In recent years, over 100 countries spoke up in multilateral fora, including the third committee of UNGA and the Human Rights Council, to voice their support for China in various ways on matters concerning Hong Kong. This fully shows that the world is not blind to the truth. We urge relevant countries to fully respect the fact that Hong Kong has already returned to China and abandon their colonial mentality. Any attempt to interfere in Hong Kong affairs in the name of the freedom of press is doomed to fail. Reuters: Argentinaâs new President Javier Milei has withdrawn the country from its planned entry into BRICS. Does the Foreign Ministry have a comment about this? On the other hand, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the UAE, Iran, and Ethiopia joined BRICS on January 1, doubling its membership from five to 10. What expectation does China have for BRICS? Is China confident that it can find common course among what analysts say members with wide-ranging foreign policy objectives? Wang Wenbin: Let me make it very clear that we are fully confident in the BRICSâ future. Since its inception 18 years ago, BRICS cooperation mechanism has increased cohesiveness and influence and become a positive and stable force for good in international affairs. You mentioned the fact that BRICS now has 10 member states. That shows exactly its bright prospect. At the request of relevant countries, BRICS decided to expand its membership, which serves the common aspiration of emerging markets and developing countries, and follows the trend towards a multipolar world. We will work with BRICS partners to strive for new results in greater BRICS cooperation. Reuters: The Netherlands has blocked ASML to conduct exports to China in a partial license revocation. Does the Foreign Ministry have any comment about this news? What does that mean to Chinese chip companies? Wang Wenbin: I believe Iâve covered what you asked about in my previous reply. We urge the Dutch side to uphold an objective and fair position and market principles, respect the spirit of contract, and take concrete actions to protect the shared interests of China and the Netherlands and the companies of the two countries and safeguard the stability of the international industrial and supply chains.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on December 29, 2023"," CNR: This year, President Xi Jinping visited Asia, Africa, Europe and America, received leaders from many countries in China, and chaired the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation and other major home-ground diplomatic events. How does Chinaâs head-of-state diplomacy guide its major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics? Mao Ning: Under the strategic guidance of head-of-state diplomacy, major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics embarked on a new journey and has written a splendid new chapter in 2023. First, China has advanced major-country relations. This yearâs head-of-state overseas visits kicked off with President Xi Jinpingâs visit to Russia. The Chinese and Russian presidents had long, sincere, friendly, and fruitful talks and exchanges, and drew up a blueprint for the growth of China-Russia relations. President Xi was invited to hold the China-US summit meeting in San Francisco. The two sides had an exchange of views on strategic and overarching issues critical to the direction of China-US relations and on major issues affecting world peace and development to stabilize and improve the bilateral relations. President Xi had meetings with French president and EU leaders. They exchanged views and reached important common understandings on China-France relations, China-EU relations, and regional and international issues of mutual concern. Second, China has enhanced solidarity and cooperation with neighbors and developing countries. In Xiâan, President Xi chaired the China-Central Asia Summit, where all parties jointly announced that they will build a closer China-Central Asia Community with a shared future. In Johannesburg, President Xi attended the 15th BRICS Summit, where BRICS expansion made a historic step forward. He co-chaired with South African President the China-Africa Leadersâ Dialogue, which demonstrated through concrete action that China and African countries will forever stand shoulder to shoulder. In Beijing, President Xi announced eight major steps China will take to support the joint pursuit of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation at the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation to help developing countries speed up the process of modernization. In Hanoi, General Secretary and President Xi reached important common understandings with Vietnamese leaders to build a China-Viet Nam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance. It is another vivid illustration of the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in neighborhood diplomacy. Third, China contributed its wisdom to the settlement of hotspot issues. Based on the common understanding reached by President Xi and Saudi and Iranian leaders and with Chinaâs support and facilitation, Saudi Arabia and Iran reached a historic agreement to resume diplomatic ties.â To facilitate the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, President Xi maintained communication with leaders from relevant parties to promote peace talks. Since the outbreak of the latest Palestinian-Israeli conflict, President Xi has outlined Chinaâs principled position on multiple occasions. At the Extraordinary Joint Meeting of BRICS Leaders, he called for an immediate ceasefire and efforts for an early solution to the question of Palestine that is comprehensive, just, sustainable and based on the two-state solution. Fourth, China has consolidated public foundation for friendly cooperation. President Xi Jinping personally reached out to the world to tell Chinaâs stories and make friends across the globe. Earlier this year, President Xi met with Henry Kissinger, Bill Gates and several other US friends, had cordial conversations with old friends from various sectors of the US in San Francisco, and delivered a historic speech to the American public while he was there. He also exchanged correspondence with friends from various countries. The letters conveyed messages of goodwill. It showed the character of a statesman who has a common touch and values the bond with the people. This has won respect and friendship from the world. President Xi Jinping once noted, âItâs hard work to travel all over the world, but weâve made more and more friends because of it. This is our reward.â As we conclude 2023 with numerous highlights in head-of-state diplomacy, let us look forward to next year.  Bloomberg: Just on your earlier comments, I just wanted to ask about Ukraine andâRussiaâand the visit by Envoy Li Hui to the region. Has there been any follow-up on that or is there a further trip planned? I just wanted to ask about the Li Hui delegation and future plans in 2024. Can we expect to see that continuing? Thatâs my first question. And secondly I just wanted to ask about the meeting on foreign policy conference this week that basically was setting the tone for Chinaâs diplomatic activities going forward. I wonder if you could just tell us a little bit more about that. And for example, can you elaborate a little bit about the timing? Why was this happening around now? And what would be the key message for the international audience that they should take away from the conference on foreign policy? Mao Ning: On your first question, China will continue to promoteâpeace talks and facilitate the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. About whether there are planned visits by Special Envoy Li Hui next year and Chinaâs future mediation or actions, I have no information to share at the moment. If something is planned, weâll release the information when appropriate. Please check back for updates. On your second question, let me thank you for your interest in the conference. This has been indeed a very important event. The Central Conference on Work Relating to Foreign Affairs was held in Beijing on December 27-28. Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Central Committeeâof the Communist Party of China (CPC), President of the Peopleâs Republic of China and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, delivered an important address. He gave a profound exposition onâthe international environment and historical mission ofâChinaâs external work on the new journey, and made comprehensive plans for Chinaâs external work for the present and coming periods. It was made clear at the conferenceâthat since the 18th CPC National Congress, historic achievements have been secured and historic changes have taken place in Chinaâs external workâon the great journey of advancing the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. We haveâopened up new prospects in major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. China has become a responsible major country with enhanced internationalâinfluence, stronger capacity to steer new endeavors, and greater moral appeal. Changes of the world, of our times, and of historical significance are unfolding like never before, and the world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation. Yetâthe overall direction of human development and progress will not change, the overall dynamics of world history moving forward amid twists and turns will not change, and the overall trend towardâa shared future for the international community will not change.â It wasâpointed out at the conference that a community with a shared future for mankind reflects the Chinese Communistsâ worldview, perception of order,âand values, accordsâwith the common aspiration of people inâall countries, and points the direction for the progress of world civilizations. It is also the noble goal pursued by China in conducting major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics for the new era. Given the series of major issues and challenges facing the world today, China calls for anâequal and orderly multipolar world and aâuniversally beneficial and inclusiveâeconomic globalization. An equal and orderlyâmultipolar world is one in which all countries, regardless of size, are treated as equals, hegemonism and power politics are rejected, and democracy is truly promoted in international relations. Aâuniversally beneficial and inclusiveâeconomic globalizationâis one that meets the common needs of all countries, especially the developing countries, and properly addresses the development imbalances between and within countries resulting from the global allocation of resources. On the new journey, major-country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics will enter a new stage where much more can be accomplished. We will be guided by Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for the New Era and Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy in particular. We must focus on the central task of the CPCâand the country, seek progress while maintaining stability, break new ground while upholdingâfundamental principles, and firmly safeguard Chinaâsâsovereignty, security and development interests. We will explore new frontiers in Chinaâs diplomatic theory and practice, foster new dynamics in the relations between China and the world, and raise Chinaâs international influence, appeal and power to shape events to a new level. We will create a more favorable international environment and provide more solid strategic support for building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chineseânation on all fronts through the Chinese path to modernization. AFP: According to Tony Chung on social media who was convicted under the National Security Law, he has arrived in the UK to seek asylum. Does the Foreign Ministry have any comment? Mao Ning: Hong Kong upholds the rule of law. All laws in Hong Kong must be observed and those who break the law must be held accountable. Those who think they can just use foreign support and get away with legal consequences will not have their way and will be held accountable.  RIA Novosti: In an interview with RIA news agency, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Western countries and some countries of the Global South met 10âdaysâagoâto discuss a âpeace formulaâ proposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He added that Russiaâs close allies who attended the meeting did not promise anyone to keep secrets from Russia on issues concerning it. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Did China attend this meeting? Mao Ning: Chinaâs position on the Ukraine crisis is clear-cut and consistent. We have played a constructive role in bringing about a ceasefire and the political settlement of the crisis. The Chinese side will continue working in its own way to promote peace talks and facilitate political settlement at an early date. NHK: A spokesperson of one of the local armed groups in Myanmar told NHK they communicated or coordinated with the Chinese authorities before they started the military operation in October against the Myanmar government. Can you confirm that? Is there any progress or updates on peace talks between Myanmar government forces and armed groups mediated by China? Mao Ning: Chinaâs position on the conflict in northern Myanmar is very clear. China firmly supports the peace process in northern Myanmar and does not support any party in provoking trouble. Ceasefire and peace talks serve the interests of relevant parties in Myanmar and are conducive to peace and stability in the China-Myanmar border area. We hope relevant parties in Myanmar will exercise maximum restraint, take the initiative in deescalating the situation on the ground and jointly bring about a soft landing of the situation in northern Myanmar.â Dragon TVï¼Itâs reported that the spokesperson of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Aguilar said that the Philippino government is considering building a permanent civilian structure on Renâai Jiao, such as a lighthouse or marine science research center. He also said that Renâai Jiao lies in their Exclusive Economic Zone where only the Philippines can build structures. They will deliver civilian supplies rather than military supplies from now on. Whatâs your response? Mao Ning: Renâai Jiao is part of Chinaâs Nansha Qundao. China has indisputable sovereignty over Nansha Qundao, including Renâai Jiao, and their adjacent waters. This was established in the long course of history and is consistent with international law including the UN Charter. It is against the principles of international law and legally untenable for the Philippines to cite the âawardâ of the South China Sea arbitration, which is illegal, null and void, to claim that Renâai Jiao falls within its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf and deny Chinaâs sovereignty over it. Renâai Jiao is an uninhabited shoal. According to the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) signed by China and ASEAN countries, parties should keep Renâai Jiao uninhabited and facility-free. On the Renâai Jiao issue, the Philippines reneged on its words, changed its policy, infringed on Chinaâs sovereignty and made provocations again and again and triggered complex situations. The spokesperson of the Armed Forces of the Philippines blatantly claimed that the Philippines will build a permanent structure. This would be another major move the Philippines could take to go back on its words, change its policy, and undermine the uninhabited and facility-free status of Renâai Jiao. This will severely infringe on Chinaâs sovereignty, andâviolate international law and the DOC. China will take resolute measures against any violation of our sovereignty and provocation, and firmly safeguard our territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.â  The following question was raised after the regular press conference:âItâs been learned that firing broke out in front of the Crown Hotel in Dong Chen, Laukkaing Township, Myanmar on the afternoon of December 25, causing casualties that included Chinese. The Myanmar government urged the Chinese nationals in Laukkaing to leave the country. Chinaâs embassy and consulates have issued a consular notice on this. Whatâs your comment? Mao Ning: China is closely following the conflict in northern Myanmar and strongly deplores the casualties of Chinese caused by the armed conflict. We have lodged serious protest to relevant parties. We once again urge parties to the conflict in northern Myanmar to stop the fighting at once, take concrete steps to protect the safety and security of Chinese projects and personnel in Myanmar and stop events endangering the safety of lives and property of Chinese nationals from happening again.â The current security situation in the Kokang self-administered zone in Myanmar is severe and complex. The Foreign Ministry reminds Chinese citizens not to travel to northern Myanmar for the time being and calls on Chinese nationals in the area to take safety precautions. Itâs quite possible that those still in Laukkaing are telecom fraud suspects. What will China do with those people? Mao Ning: China puts the people and their lives above all else. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese nationals overseas. We hope relevant parties in Myanmar to take Chinaâs concerns seriously and take concrete steps to protect the safety and security of Chinese projects and personnel in Myanmar. We call on the telecom fraud suspects in Laukkaing to return to China and turn themselves in as soon as possible so that there is still a possibility of being granted leniency. **************** In observance of New Yearâs Day holiday, our press conference will be in recess on Monday, January 1 and resumed on Tuesday, January 2. During the recess, you may still raise questions to the Spokespersonâs Office via fax, email or WeChat. This concludes the last regular press briefing of 2023. This year, we held 229 press briefings and took more than 2,000 questions. I would like to take this opportunity to extend heartfelt thanks to you all for being here with us throughout the year. We look forward to working closely with you in the year ahead to communicate Chinaâs foreign policy to the world and help it better understand China. On behalf of the Department of Press, Communication and Public Diplomacy of the Foreign Ministry and my colleagues, let me wish you a happy new year, good health and success, and your families every happiness and all the best in 2024.âThankâyouâandâseeâyouânextâyear."
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on December 28, 2023"," AFP: Chinaâs Embassy in Myanmar today reminded all Chinese nationals in Laukkaing to evacuate soon. Can you share more information with us, including the possible further mediation by the Chinese side? Mao Ning: The current security situation in the Kokang self-administered zone in Myanmar is severe and complex. We would like to remind Chinese nationals not to travel to northern Myanmar and call on Chinese nationals already in the area, especially those in Laukkaing Township, to move to safety or return to China as soon as possible and take safety precautions. China believes that maintaining the momentum of ceasefire and peace talks serves the interest of relevant parties in Myanmar and helps ensure peace and tranquility at the China-Myanmar border area. China hopes that relevant parties in Myanmar will exercise maximum restraint, actively ease the situation on the ground, together realize the soft landing of the situation in northern Myanmar and take concrete actions to protect the safety and security of Chinese projects and personnel in Myanmar.â Shenzhen TV: The UK-based Financial Times reported earlier that China is imposing a lengthy approval process and strict requirements to impede projects that lay and maintain undersea cables through the South China Sea. This has forced cable companies to reroute and bypass the South China Sea. Nikkei also reported that owing to the lengthy approval by Chinaâs competent authorities, the progress of some cable projects through the South China Sea has been slowed down. Whatâs your comments?â Mao Ning: Undersea cables are critical infrastructure for global data flow and carry around 99 percent of the worldâs intercontinental communications traffic. They are the most important type of information carrier in international communications. Over the years, China has enhanced international exchanges and cooperation in cyberspace and actively advanced the construction of undersea cables and other types of global information infrastructure. China has implemented the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea in letter and in spirit, and issued the Sea Areas Administration Law, the Marine Environment Protection Law, the Provisions Governing the Laying of Submarine Cables and Pipelines, the Provisions Governing the Protection of Submarine Cables and Pipelines and other relevant laws and regulations, which identify countriesâ rights and obligations in laying cables in waters under Chinaâs jurisdiction in accordance with the law. They provide sound legal safeguards to international undersea cables that travel through waters under Chinaâs jurisdiction. China welcomes and supports other countries and telecommunication companies in laying international undersea cables in waters under Chinaâs jurisdiction. We encourage such collaboration between Chinese companies and their foreign counterparts. China will continue to work with the international community to strengthen bilateral, regional and international dialogue and cooperation, actively advance the building of global information infrastructure including undersea cables, jointly protect the cables, and boost global digital connectivity. We will jointly build a fairer and more equitable, secure, stable and vibrant cyberspace and a community with a shared future in cyberspace. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on December 27, 2023"," CCTV: This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative put forward by President Xi Jinping. Itâs also been a fruitful year for Belt and Road cooperation. What has high-quality Belt and Road cooperation accomplished this year? Whatâs Chinaâs expectation for the cooperation in the next decade? Mao Ning: The BRI is a major initiative for international cooperation proposed by President Xi Jinping with an insightful grasp of the trend of the world and the future of mankind. Over the past decade, Belt and Road cooperation has made historic achievements and become the most popular international public good and the largest platform for international cooperation. This year has seen steady progress in trade and investment under Belt and Road cooperation. For the first 11 months, Chinaâs trade with Belt and Road partner countries totaled RMB 17.65 trillion, up by 2.6 percent year on year; non-financial FDI from China in these countries reached RMB 201.1 billion, up by 26.8 percent year on year; and the completed turnover of China-contracted projects in these countries rose to RMB 784.8 billion, up by 8.5 percent year on year. Connectivity cooperation has produced numerous highlights. For the first 11 months of this year, the China-Europe railway express ran 16,145 trains, up by 7 percent year on year, and shipped 1.749 million TEUs of cargo, up by 19 percent year on year and exceeding the total shipment for last year. The Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway, which has been in operation for just two months, has transported over 1 million passengers. Projects such as the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Tunnel in Bangladesh and the Lekki Deep Sea Port in Nigeria have opened, giving a strong boost to national and regional connectivity. Cooperation for better livelihood has yielded fruitful outcomes. The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Headquarters that China helped to build completed construction early this year. Small but practical livelihood projects, such as the Luban Workshop, the Brightness Action, programs on growing Juncao and hybrid rice and cooperation on artemisinin have brought sustained benefit to our fellow developing countries and had an extensive and positive impact. Cooperation in new areas, such as green and digital areas, is booming. China and relevant countries have jointly issued the Beijing Initiative for Belt and Road Green Development and the Beijing Initiative on Belt and Road International Digital Economy Cooperation, stepped up industrial cooperation in green energy such as hydro power, wind power and photovoltaic power, and reinvigorated traditional industries through such digital economy platforms as the Silk Road e-commerce. The third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation held in October is the culmination of the commemoration of the BRIâs 10th anniversary and marked a new stage of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. At the forum, President Xi Jinping reviewed achievements of the past decade and the good experience and announced eight major steps China will take to support the joint pursuit of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. This identified the direction, new vision and the source of impetus for BRI. We hope the 10th anniversary of BRI can be a new starting point for high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and galvanize efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.  China Daily: Several overseas media reported that a commander of the Baloch National Army that had surrendered himself to the Pakistani government disclosed that India has been secretly supporting terrorist activities in Balochistan and financing Balochistan separatist forces. Baloch officials said that Indiaâs support and use of terrorists is the main reason behind the increasing terrorist activities in the province. Whatâs your comments?â Mao Ning: We noticed relevant reports. Terrorism is humanityâs common enemy. China firmly opposes double standards on counterterrorism. To support and use terrorist groups and let them thrive out of oneâs selfish interests at the expense of international and regional security benefits no one and will only backfire. China stands for strengthening counterterrorism cooperation among all countries to jointly fight all forms of terrorism. AFP: Zambiaâs foreign minister resigned yesterday due to suspicion of taking bribes from a Chinese businessman. Could you share more information on this or your comment? Mao Ning: I noted the reports but do not have information on what exactly happened. The Chinese government asks overseas Chinese companies and individuals to strictly abide by local laws and regulations in their cooperation with local partners. Zambia is Chinaâs important partner in Africa and we will continue working with Zambia to expand and deepen bilateral cooperation in various fields and advance common development. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on December 26, 2023"," China News Service: Premier Li Qiang attended the fourth Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) Leadersâ Meeting on December 25. Do you have more information to share about the meeting and the outcomes of the meeting? Mao Ning: Yesterday, the fourth Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) Leadersâ Meeting was held via video link. The meeting was a success. Premier Li Qiang and the leaders of the five Mekong countries attended the meeting. Focusing on the theme âJoin Hands on the Building of a Community of Shared Future and Modernization among Lancang-Mekong Countriesâ, the leaders took stock of the progress of Lancang-Mekong cooperation and jointly planned for the future of the LMC. Premier Li pointed out that over the past seven years since the launch of the Lancang-Mekong cooperation mechanism, under the strategic guidance of President Xi Jinping and the leaders of the Mekong countries, the six countries have built a powerful engine to promote development, a solid backing for common security, and a strong bond of mutual understanding. In particular, China announced with Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam respectively the bilateral decision to build a community with a shared future, which will further boost efforts to build a Lancang-Mekong community with a shared future and provides a great example for building a community with a shared future for mankind. China put forward a four-point proposal on the future of the LMC. First, deepen integrated development and stick to openness and cooperation. China will launch a special loan for LMC common development to support the key projects in each country. Second, promote green cooperation. The six countries need to fully respect each otherâs legitimate right to develop and utilize water resources rationally and advance cooperation in energy transition and ecological conservation. Third, strengthen security governance, advance the Operation of âThe Safety of the Lancang-Mekong Regionâ and effectively crack down on telecom fraud and online gambling. Fourth, deepen people-to-people and cultural exchanges and cultivate new bright spots such as think tanks and subnational cooperation. Parties spoke highly of the fruitful results from Lancang-Mekong cooperation, and stressed that the six countries will share opportunities, jointly respond to challenges, plan future LMC together, further deepen and substantiate it and develop the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Economic Development Belt and a Lancang-Mekong community with a shared future. The meeting adopted the Nay Pyi Taw Declaration of the Fourth Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Leadersâ Meeting, Five-Year Plan of Action on Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (2023-2027), and Joint Initiatives on the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Innovation Corridor Development.â China Review News: On December 22 local time, US President Joe Biden signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, which contains negative China-related content. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: Despite Chinaâs opposition, the US passed and signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 that contains negative China-related content. China strongly deplores and firmly opposes this and has made serious dÃ©marches to the US side. The Act interferes in Chinaâs internal affairs, preaches US military support to Taiwan, and violates the one-China principle and the three China-US joint communiquÃ©s. We urge the US to honor the commitment of its leader of not supporting âTaiwan independenceâ, stop manipulating the Taiwan question and stop endangering peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. The Act pictures China as a threat, suppresses Chinese companies and limits normal economic, trade and people-to-people exchanges between China and the US, which serves no oneâs interest. The US needs to abandon the Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice and create a favorable environment for China-US cooperation in trade and other sectors. We urge the US to work with China to deliver on the important outcome and common understandings of the San Francisco summit. Negative China-related content in the Act should not be implemented. If the US insists on going ahead with it, China will take resolute and strong measures to firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security and development rights and interests.  Al Jazeera: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in his speech on Monday that he asked China to do more to free an Israeli hostage held by Hamas. Can you confirm that and provide more details? Does China plan to mediate for this? Mao Ning: Since the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out, China has repeatedly called for the release of all those held captive as soon as possible and has been making active efforts for this. We will work with the international community to continue to play a constructive role for realizing a ceasefire and the release of all those held captive. Al Jazeera: The Prime Minister also said that he asked China and Russia to make greater effort for releasing the Israeli hostage. Can the Foreign Ministry confirm this? Mao Ning: China is in communication with all parties on relevant issues and stands ready to work with all sides to facilitate the release of all those held captive as soon as possible and the realization of a ceasefire to bring lasting peace to the Middle East. AFP: Indonesian police said today that the death toll following the explosion of a Chinese-funded plant in Indonesia rose to 18 and dozens are being treated in the hospital. Can you give us more details? Mao Ning: In the wake of the accident, our Ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia immediately contacted Indonesia and made every effort jointly to respond to the accident. The Embassyâs task force together with Indonesian officials arrived at the scene in the industrial park yesterday to provide the company concerned with guidance on dealing with the accident.â We will continue to work with competent authorities and local government to assist the Embassy in staying in close communication with Indonesia and make sure that everything is properly handled. As to the details about injuries and deaths, we are still in the process of collecting and verifying the information.â Asahi TV: Today marks the 130th anniversary of the birth of Chairman Mao Zedong. Will the Foreign Ministry hold commemoration for the occasion? Mao Ning: Comrade Mao Zedong was at the core of the first generation of CPC central collective leadership and a great man deeply loved and respected by the whole Party and people of all ethnic groups in China. Across China, various forms of commemoration activities are held today. Reuters: Russian media Kommersant reported yesterday that foreign shareholders in a project controlled by Russiaâs Novatek, suspended the participation. This is the Arctic LNG 2 project and this is due to sanctions. Has Chinese participation through state oil majors like CNOOC and China National Petroleum Corp, in this project ended? And if so, how might this impact the ties between China and Russia? Mao Ning: China and Russia conduct normal economic and trade cooperation on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. Such cooperation should not become the target of any intervention or restriction by a third party. What has happened shows that sanction and pressuring does not serve to achieve anything but can only cause negative spillover. We oppose unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction that lack basis in international law and UN Security Council mandate. China and Russia will remain committed to normal economic and trade cooperation based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.  Xinhua News Agency: The US issued an annual human rights report related to Xinjiang and sanctioned Chinaâs two officials and three companies. China said it will take resolute countermeasures. What are these specific measures? Mao Ning: By issuing the report, the US once again spread false stories on Xinjiang and illegally sanctioned Chinese officials and companies citing so-called human rights issues. This move constitutes grave interference in Chinaâs internal affairs and violates the international law and the basic norms of international relations. The move is designed to vilify China and harmful to the lawful rights and interests of relevant Chinese officials and companies. We firmly oppose and strongly condemn the move and have made serious dÃ©marches to the US over this.â In accordance with Chinaâs Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, we will take countermeasures against American intelligence data company Kharon, which has long collected Xinjiang-related sensitive information and provided so-called evidence for Americaâs illegal sanctions related to Xinjiang, Edmund Xu, director of investigations of Kharon, and Nicole Morgret, former researcher of the Center for Advanced Defense Studies. The two persons will be prohibited from entering China (including Chinaâs mainland, the Hong Kong SAR and the Macau SAR). China will freeze the property of Kharon and the two persons in China, including their movable and immovable property, and prohibit organizations and individuals in China from transactions and cooperation with them. We again urge the US to stop smearing China, cancel the illegal unilateral sanctions on Chinese officials and companies, and stop implementing wrongful acts such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. If the US refuses to change course, China will not flinch and will respond in kind. CCTV: President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Viet Nam not long ago. This is a capstone in head-of-state diplomacy this year and an important practice of Chinaâs principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in neighborhood diplomacy. How will China advocate this principle and consolidate friendship and cooperation with neighboring countries? Mao Ning: This year marks the 10th anniversary of the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in neighborhood diplomacy. Over the past decade, China has actively implemented this important principle and put neighborhood diplomacy front and center in foreign relations. President Xi Jinping has drawn up a blueprint for Chinaâs exchanges with neighboring countries, visited them, and guided the expanding landscape of good-neighborliness and friendship. China has established strategic cooperative partnership with extensive neighboring countries and reached common understandings with more than ten countries on building a community with a shared future.ââ General Secretary and President Xi Jinpingâs successful state visit to Viet Nam is another vivid illustration of Chinaâs principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness in neighborhood diplomacy. Under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy, China will continue to advocate the principle of amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness, and deepen friendship, cooperation and intertwined interests with neighboring countries. We will carry forward Asian values featuring peace, cooperation, inclusiveness and integration and provide new assistance for solidarity, openness and progress in the region. We are ready to deliver more benefits to neighboring countries through Chinese modernization, jointly advance the modernization drive in Asia, and build a peaceful, safe and secure, prosperous, beautiful, amicable and harmonious Asian home with other countries in the region. Reuters: The Philippines said today that the country is not provoking conflict in the South China Sea. This is in response to Chinaâs accusation that Manila is encroaching on Beijingâs territory. Our question is if the Philippinesâ constant denials and rejection of Chinaâs warnings in South China Sea go on indefinitely, does China have any bottom line at all on this issue? And if so, what is Chinaâs bottom line to this? Mao Ning: The recent developments involving China and the Philippines in the South China Sea are caused by the Philippinesâ change of policy and position, refusing to honor its commitment, violation of the international law and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, and deliberate infringement of Chinaâs sovereignty and provocations. The responsibility lies with the Philippines. China will resolutely protect its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. We hope that the Philippines will make the wise choice, return to the right track of properly handling disputes through dialogue and consultation, and work with China to properly handle and manage the situation at sea.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on December 25, 2023"," CCTV: This year marks the tenth anniversary of the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind put forward by President Xi Jinping, which has been widely recognized and supported by the international community. At the same time, we have seen bloc confrontation, decoupling and supply chain disruptions and other manifestations of Cold War mentality on the rise. Some people commented that the world is dividing into âtwo blocsâ. Against this backdrop, how will China deepen and substantiate the vision? What role can the vision play in addressing current global challenges? Mao Ning: Ten years ago, faced with profound changes of the world, of our times, and of the historical trajectory, President Xi Jinping put forward the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind. Over the past decade, the vision has been translated from ideas into actions, and has provided effective safeguard for preserving world peace, injected vigorous impetus into promoting global development, and built strong synergy for addressing global challenges. It has been warmly echoed by the international community. The vision has been written into resolutions of UN General Assembly for seven years in a row, and included in resolutions or declarations of multilateral mechanisms like the SCO and BRICS. China also put forward important initiatives such as building a global community of health for all, a community with a shared future in cyberspace, and a community of life for humanity and nature, giving a strong boost to global governance in various sectors. Today, we are living in the same global village. The connections and interdependence between countries around the world are more frequent and closer than ever. No country can stay unaffected in the face of various pressing global challenges. The vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind replaces conflicts and confrontation with peaceful development, absolute security with common security, and zero-sum game with mutual benefits and win-win results, prevents cultural clashes through cultural exchanges, and champions green development to protect the planet we call home. The vision responds to the common pursuit of people in countries around the world for peace, development and cooperation, and identifies the fundamental path to solve global issues. Under the guidance of the vision, China has proposed and promoted the implementation of major initiatives including the Belt and Road cooperation, Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative. China stands ready to make joint efforts with the international community to build an open, inclusive, clean, and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security, and common prosperity, and create a better future for humanity.  Rudaw Media Network: Over the past two months, there have been more than 40 attacks on US bases in Iraq and Kurdistan region. You are Iraqâs trade partner. Are you concerned regarding the safety and security of Chinese companies operating in Iraq? Mao Ning: Iraq is Chinaâs important Belt and Road partner. In recent years, China and Iraq have deepened practical cooperation, delivering tangible benefits to the two countries and two peoples. China closely follows Iraqâs security situation and is willing to increase cooperation with Iraq to ensure the safety and smooth progress of cooperation projects. Reuters: Chinaâs official media today accused the Philippines of repeatedly violating Chinaâs sovereignty in the South China Sea, spreading false news and colluding with foreign forces to undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea. Will the two sides hold a new round of talks? How does China view the risk of armed maritime conflict? Mao Ning: China will not weaken in its resolve to protect its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. For months, the Philippines has been making provocations on Renâai Jiao and other issues and drawing forces outside the region into those issues. China is compelled under those circumstances to take necessary measures to firmly respond to it. That said, Chinaâs door of dialogue remains open. We are ready to work with the Philippines to properly handle maritime issues through negotiation and consultation. We hope the Philippines will stop pursuing the wrong course at once. AFP: At least 14 persons were killed yesterday in Indonesia in an explosion at the Chinese funded plants. Can you tell us if some Chinese nationals were among the victims? Mao Ning: Weâve learned that the accident has so far killed 13, including four Chinese employees and injured many who have been taken to hospital. Weâre saddened by the deaths and injuries and express our condolences over the victims. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs are working closely with other government agencies and relevant local government in China on the matter. We have instructed the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia to verify the situation and handle the accident at once. The Embassy immediately activated the emergency response mechanism and contacted relevant parties to make every effort to save and treat the injured and find out what caused the accident. The Embassy is also giving guidance to the company concerned on follow-up arrangements. We will stay in close communication with Indonesia to make sure that everything is properly handled. China News Service: We noticed that on December 22 local time, the 78th UN General Assembly adopted a resolution by consensus to list the Lunar New Year as a UN floating holiday, which means the lunar new year will be celebrated at the UN too. Any comment on that? Mao Ning: The Lunar New Year, or what we call Spring Festival in China, is the oldest and the most important traditional festival in the Chinese culture. Itâs a time for family reunion and ringing in the new year. Itâs celebrated in China and around the world. Some rough estimates suggest that the Lunar New Year is a public holiday in almost 20 countries and celebrated in various ways by about one-fifth of humanity. Traditional Lunar New Year activities are organized in nearly 200 countries and regions. The festival has become a global cultural event, bringing joy to people around the world.â The Lunar New Year symbolizes joy, harmony and peace and its Chinese name âSpring Festivalâ conveys the greetings and warmth of the spring season. The festival embodies the core values of harmony, love and peace in Chinese culture. We look forward to celebrating the Spring Festival with the world and hope all civilizations will live in harmony, prosper together and engage in exchanges and mutual learning, and that people of all countries will enjoy better mutual understanding and friendship and work together for building a community with a shared future for mankind.  Global Times: It is reported that the Japanese government adopted the updated Three Principles on Transfer of Defense Equipment and Technology and its implementation guidelines (herein referred to as âThree Principlesâ) on December 22 with a decision to provide its home-made Patriot air defence missiles to the United States. It is the first time that Japan has allowed the export of destruction weapons since its Cabinetâs adoption of the Three Principles in 2014. On the same day, the Cabinet approved the budget for Fiscal Year 2024 with a record defense budget of around JPY 7.9 trillion, up by 16.6 percent year on year. What is your comment? Mao Ning: Given Japanâs recent history of militarist aggression, Japanâs military and security moves are closely watched by its Asian neighbors and the international community. In recent years, Japan has been drastically readjusting its security policy, increasing defense spending year after year, easing the restrictions on arms export and seeking military breakthroughs. We urge Japan to earnestly respect the security concerns of neighboring countries, reflect on its history of aggression, commit itself to the path of peaceful development and earn the trust of its Asian neighbors and the wider international community through concrete actions. The Paper: Last Friday, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 2720 on the humanitarian condition in Gaza, with 13 votes in favor and two abstentions. How does China see the resolution? Mao Ning: Resolution 2720 is the second Security Council resolution since the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out. The resolution calls for urgent action to expand humanitarian assistance to Gaza and creating the conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities. For publicly known reasons, the resolution does not quite come up to international expectations and has certain gaps that needed to be filled. Yet in light of the urgent situation on the ground and the position of Palestine and other Arab countries, China voted in favor of the resolution. The latest round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict has already killed and injured tens of thousands of innocent civilians and the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate. We hope the resolution will be effectively implemented, more humanitarian aid will reach Gaza as soon as possible and a monitoring mechanism will be set up. That said, realizing a ceasefire remains the absolute priority and prerequisite for everything else. China will continue to work with all parties to enhance coordination and galvanize more responsible and meaningful actions in the Security Council to make relentless efforts for an early cessation of hostilities in Gaza, the implementation of the two-state solution and peace and stability in the Middle East. Beijing Daily: Itâs reported that two employees working for Vivoâs India unit were arrested by Indiaâs Enforcement Directorate. They will next appear in court on December 26. Vivoâs India unit said that it was deeply shocked by the arrest; The recent arrests show that Indiaâs harassment against Vivo still continues, which induces an environment of uncertainty amongst the wider industry landscape; Vivo will resolutely address these accusations through all legal means. Recently, itâs also said that Chinese staff of the ZTEâs India unit might soon be forced to leave India because they could not get visa or the visa extension permit. Whatâs your comment? Mao Ning: We are closely following what you mentioned. The Chinese government firmly supports Chinese businesses in safeguarding their lawful rights and interests. We hope that India will fully recognize the mutually beneficial nature of the business cooperation between our two countries and provide a fair, just, transparent and non-discriminatory business environment. The Chinese embassy and consulates in India will continue to provide consular protection and assistance to the individuals concerned in accordance with the law. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on December 22, 2023"," The fourth Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) Leadersâ Meeting will be held via videolink on December 25. Premier Li Qiang of the State Council and the leaders of the five Mekong countries, namely Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam will attend the meeting.â CCTV: Premier Li Qiang will attend the fourth Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) Leadersâ Meeting on December 25. How does China view the current development of the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation? Whatâs Chinaâs expectation for this meeting? Wang Wenbin: The Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) is the first new sub-regional cooperation mechanism focused on building a community with a shared future with wide consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits of the six Lancang-Mekong countries. In the past seven years since its inception, LMC enjoyed rapid development and put in place an LMC framework guided by leaders and underpinned by all-round cooperation and broad participation. With progress and results delivered daily, monthly and annually, we have created an LMC speed, and fostered an LMC culture featuring equality, sincerity, mutual assistance and kinship. LMC has become a stellar example for countries to develop relations with each other, conduct regional cooperation and pursue South-South cooperation. Lancang-Mekong countries are at an important stage of speeding up development and achieving modernization. At the eighth LMC Foreign Ministersâ Meeting held earlier this month, parties focused on regional stability and prosperity, highlighted the growth of new development advantages in the region and made full preparation for the upcoming Leadersâ Meeting. We hope that the upcoming Leadersâ Meeting will advocate building a Lancang-Mekong community with a shared future, focus on cooperation in such areas as integrated development, environmental protection, technological innovation, security governance and people-to-people exchanges, have in-depth discussion on advancing the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Economic Development Belt, and contribute to regional countriesâ common development and modernization. NBC: Itâs reported that Chinese leader said China will reunify Taiwan with the mainland. While this is a known policy position, does this raising of the Taiwan issue in such a direct manner at the highest level with the United States imply that there is a change in Chinaâs tone or determination on the Taiwan issue, in particular ahead of Taiwan election? Wang Wenbin: During his meeting with President Biden in San Francisco this November, President Xi Jinping outlined Chinaâs principled position on the Taiwan question. The readout of the meeting was released soon after their discussion. President Xi pointed out that the Taiwan question remains the most important and most sensitive issue in China-US relations. China takes seriously the positive statements made by the United States in the Bali meeting, and the US should match its action with its commitment of not supporting âTaiwan independenceâ, stop arming Taiwan and support Chinaâs peaceful reunification.â It needs to be pointed out that resolving the Taiwan question and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration of all sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. Our position of advancing reunification is consistent, rock-solid and unshakable. China will realize reunification, and this is unstoppable.â China Daily: During the summit meeting in San Francisco, China and the United States agreed to establish a working group on counternarcotics cooperation and carry out counternarcotics cooperation. What specific measures has China taken so far? Wang Wenbin: Carrying out counternarcotics cooperation is one of the important common understandings reached between the two Presidents during their meeting in San Francisco. To deliver on that, the US side has lifted sanctions on relevant Chinese law enforcement institute. Recently, China has been engaged in campaigns against fentanyl and its precursor chemicals, and cracked down on illegal and criminal activities involving the smuggling, illicit manufacturing, trafficking and abuse of fentanyl-related substances. We have carried out a sweeping inspection of key businesses, personnel and equipment. We have been working to clean up information about online sales of fentanyl, and strictly prevent the smuggling and trafficking of relevant chemical substances to protect peopleâs physical and mental health. The counternarcotics authorities of China and the US are resuming regular communication. The Chinese side has notified the US side of the progress made in US-related law enforcement operations against narcotics. China has responded to US request for verifying clues on certain cases and taken action. The two sides are in close communication on setting up a working group on counternarcotics cooperation. I need to stress that progress in resuming China-US counternarcotics cooperation has not come easy and needs to be doubly cherished by both sides. We hope that the US side will show sincerity, work with China in the same direction and continue to carry out practical counternarcotics cooperation based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit.  Al Jazeera: Lately, the Israeli authorities have been confiscating occupied territories in the name of urban development, especially the Palestinian-owned land in East Jerusalem. Such practice violates international law and has become a fuse directly causing the escalation of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which undermines peace and sabotages the possibility of the two-state solution. What is Chinaâs position on Israelâs acts? As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, what measures can China take to stop these acts of Israel which violate international law? Wang Wenbin: China opposes Israel building settlements on the occupied Palestinian territory. China opposes unilateral change to Jerusalemâs status and status quo shaped by history. We believe that the issue of Jerusalemâs status should be settled through negotiations by parties concerned in accordance with relevant UN resolutions. As Palestinian-Israeli tensions continue to escalate and risk of spillover of the conflict in Gaza heightens, relevant parties need to be prudent and avoid any move that might lead to escalation or get the situation to spiral out of control. Reuters: Angola is the second largest exporter of crude oil in Africa. It announced yesterday that it would exit from OPEC. Since 2010, Angola has been a reliable strategic partner of China. Is there any negative impact of the exit from OPEC on the trade relationship between China and Angola?â Wang Wenbin: China is committed to practical cooperation with Angola in various fields on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. CCTV: President Xi Jinping had a recent phone call with President of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega ahead of the second anniversary of the resumption of diplomatic relations. The two heads of state announced the establishment of strategic partnership between the two countries. This marks a capstone of Chinaâs effort this year to enhance friendship with Latin American countries. Can you share more details of Chinaâs cooperation with Nicaragua and with Latin American countries? Wang Wenbin: President Xi Jinping and President Ortega jointly announced the establishment of strategic partnership between China and Nicaragua. This is a milestone event in the history of China-Nicaragua relations. It serves the common interests of the two countries and the two peoples, and promotes the common development and prosperity of the two countries. Over the past two years since diplomatic ties were resumed, the two countries, guided by head-of-state diplomacy, have steered bilateral relations in the right direction, cemented political mutual trust, increased strategic coordination and accelerated practical cooperation. Both countries have benefited from resuming diplomatic ties. The resumption and growth of relations with Nicaragua is an epitome of how China has deepened ties with Latin American and Caribbean countries in recent years. Costa Rica, Panama, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras have either established or resumed diplomatic relations with China, which reflects the trend of history and the times. More and more Latin American and Caribbean countries have joined high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. They have shown support for and taken part in the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilization Initiative and are part of the effort to build a community with a shared future for China and Latin American countries. Though China and Latin American and Caribbean countries belong to different hemispheres, we share closer ties and a common futureâmost importantly because China-Latin American cooperation benefits both sides and delivers common development. China now has five free trade partners in Latin America. We began negotiations with Honduras on a free trade agreement less than four months after establishing diplomatic relations. China and Nicaragua completed negotiations on the free trade agreement within just one year, which will come into force on the first day of the new year. The agreement will bring more real benefits to the two peoples. The projects assisted by China or undertaken by Chinese companies on infrastructure, energy and power, and peopleâs livelihood, are the latest showcase of China and Latin America working together for peopleâs better lives.â China always believes that Latin America is not a wrestling ground between different forces. We respects Latin American countriesâ right to independently choosing development paths that suit their national conditions, and supports Latin American countries in seeking strength through solidarity and addressing issues in the region through Latin American ways. China stands ready to work with Latin America to deepen China-Latin America relations in a new era characterized by equality, mutual benefit, innovation, openness and more benefits for the people and further promote the building of the China-Latin America community with a shared future.  Bloomberg: China will halt the export of a range of rare earth technologies while Beijing already has some of these limits already in place. Itâs now widened a list of technologies that cannot be transferred overseas to include the processing of rare earth metals and magnets. Can you respond to that? Wang Wenbin: Are you referring to the Catalogue of Technologies Prohibited and Restricted from Export released by relevant Chinese authorities? Bloomberg: Why is China doing this? Wang Wenbin: Chinaâs competent authorities have responded to that. The revision of the Catalogue of Technologies Prohibited and Restricted from Export is a routine update for China to adapt to the latest technological advancement and better manage technology trade. The revision reduced the catalogue from 164 to 134 items.â China is committed to promoting reform and development through opening up. We are always ready to create enabling conditions for international economic and trade cooperation on the basis of ensuring national economic security and development interests. AFP: Top US and China military officials spoke for the first time in more than a year yesterday. Do you have any details to offer and was Taiwan among the topic discussed? Wang Wenbin: Competent authorities have issued the readout on the video conversation between member of the Central Military Commission (CMC) and Chief of the CMC Joint Staff Department Liu Zhenli and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Charles Brown at US request. The readout mentioned the Taiwan question, which you may refer to.â We hope the US will work with China to implement the important common understanding between the two presidents during their meeting in San Francisco on resuming mil-to-mil communication and exchange and carry out relevant exchange and cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect. China News Service: Recently, US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said that in lunar exploration, he doesnât believe the Chinese have shown much of an interest in working with the United States and the space is a contested area. Whatâs your comment?â Wang Wenbin: Today, the spokesperson for the China National Space Administration (CNSA) has shared relevant facts and history of space cooperation between China and the US. You may refer to it.â China is committed to the peaceful exploration and use of outer space. We are ready to have international space exchanges and cooperation with all countries on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, peaceful use and inclusive development and actively promote the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind in the field of outer space. We have always been open to having space exchanges and cooperation with the US. The two sides established mechanisms such as the working group on Earth science and space science cooperation and the China-US Civil Space Dialogue. The US, however, views space cooperation with China from a Cold War perspective. US domestic legislation such as the Wolf Amendment, the US Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 and the America COMPETES Act of 2022 were adopted to limit and thwart space exchanges and cooperation with China. The US even imposed unilateral sanctions on relevant Chinese companies. This is the real reason impeding cooperation between the two sides. In the field of lunar and deep space exploration, China has actively advanced international cooperation. CNSA recently issued the CE-5 Lunar Research Sample Distribution Guide and the Announcement of International Cooperation Opportunities for the Changâe-8 Mission. We welcome scientists and researchers from the US and all other countries to apply in line with the procedures. If the US truly wants to advance space exchanges and cooperation with China, it needs to revoke and abolish relevant legislation, stop making irresponsible comments and take practical steps to remove the stumbling blocks on the path towards cooperation. Bloomberg: The US Commerce Department will begin gathering of information on the Chinese production of legacy semiconductors. Those are not the advanced chips. Those are just like regular chips. Itâs looking to track how deeply reliant US companies have become on the technology from China. Thereâs a belief that China is underpricing the sale of legacy semiconductors. Can you respond to that? Wang Wenbin: The global industrial and supply chains are shaped and developed by the laws of market and business choices combined. Any deliberate intervention to instrumentalize and weaponize economic and trade issues is a violation of the principles of market economy and fair competition and will pose risks to the security of global industrial and supply chains. It will hurt the interests of the whole world, including the US itself. The US needs to respect international trade rules and the principle of market economy and create enabling conditions for China-US economic and trade cooperation. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on December 21, 2023"," CCTV: Recently, Steven Barnett, IMF Senior Resident Representative in China, said in an interview that China will contribute one-third of global economic growth in 2023. He predicted that higher and more resilient growth is within reach for China in 2024. Whatâs your comments? Wang Wenbin: We noted that interview. Lately, many international organizations like the IMF and the OECD have revised up their 2023 growth projections for China and are confident in Chinaâs economic prospects next year. China is widely considered the biggest driver for the world economy. The research of the IMF shows that faster growth in China has positive spillovers on the rest of the world. A one percentage point increase in China would, on average, increase the level of output in other economies by 0.3 percent. China has a hyper-scale market with the biggest potential in the world. Macroeconomic policies introduced by the Chinese government have given the economy a strong push. There is ample room for enhanced implementation of monetary and fiscal polices. Chinaâs deepening of reform and opening up across the board provides strong impetus for sustained sound economic development. A new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation in the world also presents a broad stage for the Chinese economy. All in all, there are more favorable conditions than adverse factors for Chinaâs development, the trend of economic rebound and sound long-term trajectory has not changed, and the factors and conditions supporting high-quality development are increasing. We welcome businesses from around the world to continue coming to China for global success. We will continue to expand high-level opening up, improve the business environment, step up intellectual property protection, form an open and globally competitive innovation eco-system and share with the world Chinaâs development achievements. AFP: On Tuesday, the spokesperson said that Chinaâs maritime disputes with the Philippines do not represent the entirety of the bilateral relationship and that China was willing to handle them through dialogue and consultation. However, yesterday, the Chinese side said the bilateral relationship is at a crossroads until the Philippines to proceed with caution. Can the Foreign Ministry provide a reason for this sudden change in the tone of the statement towards the Philippines?â Wang Wenbin: I suggest that you take another close look at the readout that we released on the phone call between Chinese and Philippine foreign ministers. It is absolutely wrong to think that there has been a major change in Chinaâs tone on the issue.â Yesterday, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi had a phone call with Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo at the request of the Philippines. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said that China-Philippines relations face serious difficulty and the root cause lies in the Philippinesâ change of policy and position, refusing to honor its commitment and repeated provocations that undermine Chinaâs legitimate and lawful rights and interests. The bilateral relationship is now at a crossroads. Where it will go depends on what choice will be made. The Philippines must be very prudent about it. On what you said, I would like to stress that when it comes to maritime disputes with our neighbors, Chinaâs position is consistent and clear without any change. Our commitment to properly managing disputes through dialogue and consultation has not changed. Our willingness to work with the Philippines to implement the previously reached understandings has not changed. Our policy of working with the Philippines and other ASEAN countries to safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea has not changed. Last but not least, our resolve to safeguard our sovereignty and legitimate rights and interests has not changed and will not change. We hope that the Philippines will decide rationally, follow the effective way for neighbors to get along with each other and work with China to properly handle and manage the situation at sea.  Bloomberg: Reports show that the Chinese leader said Beijing would reunify with Taiwan, but the timing has not yet been decided. Can I get your reaction? Wang Wenbin: During his meeting with President Biden in San Francisco this November, President Xi Jinping outlined Chinaâs principled position on the Taiwan question. He pointed out that the Taiwan question remains the most important and most sensitive issue in China-US relations. China takes seriously the positive statements made by the United States in the Bali meeting, and the US side should take real actions to honor its commitment of not supporting âTaiwan independence,â stop arming Taiwan, and support Chinaâs peaceful reunification.â RIA Novosti: The US State Departmentâs spokesperson Matthew Miller said earlier that the United States would welcome China playing a constructive role in trying to prevent attacks in the Red Sea. I wonder if China is ready to play more active role in ensuring security in the Red Sea region. Wang Wenbin: The Red Sea is an important international trade route for goods and energy. Safeguarding the security and stability of the region serves the common interest of the international community. China stands for protecting the safety of international sea lanes and against causing disturbance to civilian ships. We believe relevant parties, especially major countries with influence, need to play a constructive and responsible role in keeping the shipping lanes safe in the Red Sea. AFP: Given the continued fighting in Myanmar especially the fighting near planned development along the China-Myanmar economic corridor, does the Foreign Ministry have any new comments on the conflict there?â Wand Wenbin: We have repeated Chinaâs position on the situation in northern Myanmar. China has been working actively to get relevant parties in Myanmar to effectively implement what has been agreed, exercise maximum restraint, actively ease the situation on the ground, properly manage sporadic confrontation events during ceasefire and maintain the momentum of ceasefire and peace talks.ââ China will continue its effort in helping to stop the fighting and promote talks in northern Myanmar and jointly work for a soft landing of the situation in northern Myanmar. We also hope that parties concerned in Myanmar will keep the China-Myanmar border area peaceful and stable and protect the safety and security of Chinese projects and personnel in Myanmar.  TASS: Ukraine yesterday added China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC) to the list of international sponsors of the war. Does the Foreign Ministry have any comment? Wang Wenbin: On the Ukrainian issue, China always stands on the side of peace and justice. We firmly oppose relevant Ukraine agency adding Chinese company to the relevant list. We ask Ukraine to correct its mistake at once and undo the negative effect.ââ Bloomberg: Thereâs a report that the Biden administration is considering increasing trade tariffs, particularly on Chinese electric vehicles. Can you respond? Wang Wenbin: China has made it very clear that there is no winner in a trade or tariff war. The US unilateral tariff increases are against the principles of market economy and fair competition and threaten global industrial and supply chain security. This is textbook protectionism and may have violated WTOâs most-favored-nation principle and national treatment principle. China is strongly opposed to it. We urge the US to abide by WTO rules, uphold the trade order for fair competition and provide a fair, just and nondiscriminatory business environment for foreign companies. China will follow closely whatâs to happen and do whatâs needed to protect our lawful rights and interests. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on December 20, 2023"," Shenzhen TV: China put forward the vision of jointly building a Green Silk Road years ago. Can you share with us how China has contributed to green development through Belt and Road cooperation and what experience has been gained through such cooperation? Wang Wenbin: The building of a Green Silk Road, an important part of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, follows the global trend of green and low-carbon development, and provides experience and pathways for BRI partner countries in their effort to enhance environmental protection, tackle climate challenge and implement the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The cooperation has shown strong vibrancy. Over the past decade, China has issued policy documents on enhancing environmental management for overseas projects, promoting the green development of Belt and Road cooperation, enhancing international cooperation on green energy, and stopping building new coal-fired power projects overseas, and identified the priorities for the Green Silk Road. China has also worked with BRI partner countries to launch the Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on Green Development, propose the Green Investment Principles for the BRI, and establish the BRI International Green Development Coalition as part of the effort to build platforms for extensive exchange and cooperation on green development and build up international consensus. By the end of last month, China has signed 48 South-South cooperation documents on climate change with 39 partner countries, rolled out over 70 climate mitigation and adaptation projects with more than 30 partner countries including Ethiopia, Pakistan, Samoa, Chile and Egypt, and set up a number of low-carbon demonstration zones. China also helped train over 10,000 environmental and climate professionals for more than 100 developing countries through projects such as the Green Silk Road Envoys Program. The vision and technology of green development have been integrated into a number of flagship projects, including the China-Europe Railway Express, Mombasa-Nairobi Railway, China-Laos Railway, Indonesia Tsingshan Industrial Park and Vientiane Saysettha Low-Carbon Demonstration Zone in Laos, providing a strong boost to energy saving, environmental protection and emission reduction, which has been widely commended by the people in relevant countries. Going forward, China will stay committed to the path of Chinese modernization featuring harmony between man and nature, work with BRI partner countries to make green a defining feature of high-quality development, aim for high standard, more benefits for the people and sustainable growth, elevate and expand green development cooperation, advance international cooperation in addressing climate change and together protect the planet we call home.  Reuters: Argentinean media reports that China has put on hold the USD 6.5 billion currency swap line arrangement between China and Argentinaâs central banks. Could you confirm this? And if so, this was put on hold, why is that? Wang Wenbin: Iâd refer you to competent authorities on that. Iâd like to reiterate that China is committed to cooperation with Argentina on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Global Times: Chinaâs Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Zhang Jun submitted the instrument of ratification of the Firearms Protocol to the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. It was reported earlier that Chinaâs ratification of the Firearms Protocol will help China and other developing countries achieve substantial progress in firearms management cooperation. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Wang Wenbin: The Chinese government always puts our people and their lives above all else and has been emphasizing the multiple challenges that gun proliferation has brought to socioeconomic development of countries and to regional and international peace and stability. The ratification of the Firearms Protocol is yet another major step taken by China to implement the Global Security Initiative, practice multilateralism and uphold international and regional peace and stability. China is one of the safest countries with the lowest crime rate and the fewest gun and bomb attacks. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a responsible member of the international community, China is ready to use the ratification of the Firearms Protocol as an opportunity to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with all parties in the field of small arms and light weapons, with an emphasis on enhancing relevant capacity building of developing countries, and take concrete steps to practice the vision of building a community with a shared future for mankind.â Bloomberg: Can you help clarify the situation in Myanmar? Just because China says a temporary ceasefire was agreed upon when the Myanmar junta and rebel groups met in China. But now rebel groups are saying that fighting is continuing. Can you give some clarity on the situation? Is there indeed a ceasefire? Wang Wenbin: This question has been asked yesterday, and we have made the response. Iâd like to share with you more information. With Chinaâs active mediation and continuous effort, relevant parties in Myanmar held peace talks in Kunming and signed a temporary ceasefire agreement. China hopes that relevant parties in Myanmar will effectively implement what has been agreed, exercise maximum restraint, actively ease the situation on the ground, properly manage sporadic confrontation events during ceasefire and maintain the momentum of ceasefire and peace talks. China will continue engaging parties concerned to help end the conflict and promote talks in northern Myanmar and jointly work for a soft landing of the situation in northern Myanmar.  TASS: Over the course of this year, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Chinese Premier of the State Council Li Qiang have held three meetings. How does China view the communication between the leaders of the two countries this year? What is Chinaâs expectation for dialogue with Russia next year? Wang Wenbin: You mentioned that Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Premier Li Qiang have met several times this year. Let me take this opportunity to share some details about the recent regular meeting between Chinese and Russian heads of government. This morning, President Xi Jinping met with Prime Minister Mishustin at the Great Hall of the People. President Xi noted that this year, he has met President Putin twice. The two countries have carried out close exchanges between the governments, legislatures, and political parties and at the sub-national level. Practical cooperation in various areas has experienced sound and steady development. Within the first 11 months of this year, bilateral trade already reached the annual trade target of USD 200 billion jointly set by President Xi and President Putin. This shows the enormous resilience and potential for the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. To ensure the sound growth of China-Russia relations is a strategic choice made by both sides based on the fundamental interests of the two peoples. China supports the Russian people in following the development path they have chosen. China will work with Russia and take the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties next year as a new starting point to magnify the positive effect of our high-level political relations and continue supporting each other in economic and social development and national revitalization. President Xi Jinping stressed that the Chinese economyâs strong resilience, ample potential, broad maneuver space and the fundamentals sustaining Chinaâs sound economic growth in the long run stay unchanged. Chinaâs commitment to high-quality development and high-level opening up will create new opportunities for the development of all countries, including Russia. The two sides need to fully leverage the strengths of political mutual trust, economic complementarity, infrastructure connectivity and people-to-people bond, add new dimensions to cooperation, deepen cooperation in areas of economy, trade, energy and infrastructure, and jointly safeguard the security and stability of the industrial and supply chains. The two sides need to work for the success of the China-Russia Years of Culture in the next two years by designing and carrying out a variety of cultural exchange events, so as to consolidate the social and public foundation for the ever-lasting friendship between the two countries. Yesterday, Premier Li Qiang and Prime Minister Mishustin co-chaired the 28th regular meeting between Chinese and Russian heads of government. Premier Li Qiang noted that under the strategic guidance of President Xi Jinping and President Putin, China-Russia relations have enjoyed robust growth with stronger political mutual trust, deepened people-to-people friendship, more resilient practical cooperation and closer coordination on international affairs, which provides an example of a new type of major-country relations. China stands ready to work with Russia to take the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties next year as an opportunity to deliver on the important common understandings of the two presidents, carry forward the ever-lasting friendship, work for new, greater progress in bilateral relations, improve the wellbeing of the two peoples and contribute more stability and positive energy to the world. The two heads of government heard the work reports from the two sidesâ representatives of the China-Russia investment cooperation committee, the China-Russia energy cooperation committee, the committee for the regular meetings between Chinese and Russian heads of government, the intergovernmental commission for cooperation of Northeast China and the Far East and Baikal region of Russia, and the China-Russia committee on humanities cooperation. The two heads of government fully recognized the efficient and practical work of the committees over the past year. The two sides agreed that as China and Russia are committed to development and revitalization, the two sides can build up inner driving forces for the growth of bilateral relations by expanding trade and agricultural cooperation, creating a better investment environment for each otherâs companies, jointly safeguarding energy security, improving connectivity, enhancing people-to-people exchange and sub-national cooperation, and ensuring the security and stability of the industrial and supply chains. The two heads of government announced the successful conclusion of the 2022-2023 Years of Sports Exchanges and expressed the desire to make the 2024-2025 Years of Culture a great success. I would also like to add that China and Russia are each otherâs largest neighbors and comprehensive strategic partners of coordination for a new era. Both countries are permanent members of the UN Security Council and major emerging markets. We enjoy complete mechanisms of high-level exchange and leaders of the two countries maintain close communication. These are an integral part of the sound and steady growth of China-Russia relations. Next year marks the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between China and Russia and will open the China-Russia Years of Culture. We hope that the two countries will deepen bilateral cooperation on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit through dialogue and communication, and enhance people-to-people and sub-national exchanges for greater benefits to the two countries and the two peoples.â AFP: You just briefed us on Prime Minister Mishustinâs visit to China. Did the two sides talk about Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine? Wang Wenbin: China has released the readouts on the regular meeting between Chinese and Russian heads of government. You may refer to that.  CCTV: Itâs been reported that after a magnitude-6.2 earthquake struck Jishishan County of Linxia Prefecture, Gansu Province on December 18, leaders of many countries and international organizations have expressed sympathies to China. Can you give us some details? Wang Wenbin: Following the earthquake in Jishishan County of Linxia Prefecture, Gansu Province, leaders of various countries, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, King of Cambodia Norodom Sihamoni, Pakistani President Arif Alvi, Maldivesâ President Mohamed Muizzu, ROK President Yoon Suk-yeol, UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the Central African Republic Faustin-Archange TouadÃ©ra, Belorussian President Aleksandr Lukashenko, Kazakhstanâs President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Turkmenistanâs President Serdar Berdimuhamedov, Uzbekistanâs President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, Tajikistanâs President Emomali Rahmon,â German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Italian President Sergio Mattarella, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, the three members of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungarian President Katalin NovÃ¡k, Nicaraguaâs President Daniel Ortega, Bangladeshâs Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, have sent messages or letters to express deep sympathies to President Xi Jinping and condolences over the victims of the earthquake. Other leaders from various countries and international organizations, including Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, Chairman of the State Duma of Russia Vyacheslav Volodin, Pakistani Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan Muhammad Sadiq Sanjrani, Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan Raja Pervez Ashraf, Thailandâs Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin, Vice President of the Maldives Hussain Mohamed Latheef, Chairman of the Peopleâs Council of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdymukhammedov, Uzbekistanâs Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov, Serbian First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Ivica Dacic, New Zealandâs Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Winston Peters, Dominican Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, Prime Minister of Grenada Dickon Mitchell, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez, UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres and President of the 78th session of the UN General Assembly Dennis Francis, also extended sympathies to China through messages and other means. Countries such as Afghanistan, Nepal, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, TÃ¼rkiye, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, Ethiopia, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Moldova, France, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Cyprus, the US, Australia, Canada, Cuba, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Mexico, Ecuador, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru and Chile have expressed sympathies to China by various means. We would like to express our heartfelt appreciation for their well wishes. After the earthquake, General Secretary Xi Jinping made important instructions, asking for all-out search and rescue, timely treatment of the injured, effort to properly look after those hit by the disaster, and every possible effort to protect the safety of lives and property. Premier Li Qiang gave instructions for all-out rescue and relief efforts. Yesterday, Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing urgently led a working group from the State Council to the region hit by the earthquake to guide the relief work. As we speak, various rescue and relief teams are working around the clock to respond to the disaster. Disaster relief materials, such as cotton tents, folding beds, quilts and winter coats are being sent to the region without delay. All work is proceeding in a timely and orderly manner. We believe that under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee and with the strong support from various sectors across China, the people in the quake area will overcome the disaster and rebuild their homes.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on December 19, 2023"," CCTV: Egyptâs National Elections Authority announced the result of the presidential election on the night of December 18, Beijing time. Incumbent Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi was re-elected. What is Chinaâs comment? Wang Wenbin: We would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations on the smooth presidential election in Egypt and on the re-election of President El-Sisi. We believe that under the leadership of President El-Sisi, Egypt will achieve greater success in its national development. China and Egypt enjoy a traditional friendship. In recent years, under the strategic guidance of President Xi Jinping and President El-Sisi, bilateral relations have entered the fast lane, with fruitful practical cooperation in various areas and ever-deeper friendship between the two peoples. China views its relations with Egypt from a strategic height and long-term perspective. We would like to continue working with Egypt to firmly support each other, deepen and expand Belt and Road cooperation, and take the China-Egypt comprehensive strategic partnership to a new height. Bloomberg: Can you comment on the UK government demanding consular access to Jimmy Lai, who is also a UK citizen? Wang Wenbin: We have stated our position yesterday, and I would like to reiterate that Hong Kong follows the rule of law, any law in Hong Kong must be observed and those who break the law must be held accountable. Jimmy Lai is a major mastermind and participant of the anti-China riots in Hong Kong. He is an agent and pawn of the anti-China forces, and the person behind the previous instability in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong law enforcement and judicial authorities have handled and tried the case in accordance with the law. This is fully justified, legitimate and lawful. Attempts to smear, disturb and sabotage Hong Kongâs national security law will not succeed. NHK: The Foreign Ministry Spokesperson said on December 14 that with Chinaâs facilitation, Myanmarâs military and relevant parties reached agreement on a temporary ceasefire, but relevant UN agencies reported that the fighting still continues. How do you respond to this? Wang Wenbin: China supports the peace process of northern Myanmar and has provided support and facilitation for dialogue and contact between relevant parties in Myanmar. Our position is consistent. China hopes that relevant parties in Myanmar can speed up efforts to implement what has been agreed, exercise maximum restraint, actively ease the situation on the ground, promptly manage sporadic confrontation events and together realize the soft landing of the situation in northern Myanmar.  Reuters: According to Philippine media, Philippine President Marcos said that Philippine diplomatic efforts with China is heading âin poor directionâ. Has the Philippines invited China for a new round of talks? Will China invite the Philippines for talks? What does Marcos mean by saying âin poor directionâ?â Wang Wenbin: The recent events between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea are caused by deliberate infringement of Chinaâs sovereignty and the provocations of the Philippines. The responsibility lies with the Philippines. We will resolutely protect our territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests.â At the same time, maritime disputes do not represent the entirety of China-Philippines relations. We stand ready to properly handle disputes through dialogue and consultation with the Philippines and will not close our door of dialogue and contact with the Philippines. We hope that the Philippines will make the right choice, seriously honor its commitment of properly handling disputes through dialogue and consultation and work with China to pursue the healthy and steady growth of bilateral ties and jointly safeguard peace and stability in the region. Beijing Daily: Itâs reported that on December 17 local time, Serbian President Vucic declared the victory of the coalition around the ruling Serbian Progressive Party in parliamentary elections, which won more than half of the seats in the National Assembly, the number needed to form a government. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Wang Wenbin: We congratulate Serbia on its smooth parliamentary and local elections. We believe that under the leadership of President Vucic and the new government of Serbia, Serbia will continue to make new progress in national development. China attaches great importance to the growth of China-Serbia relations. We look forward to working with Serbia to consolidate our political mutual trust, deepen practical cooperation in various areas and bring China-Serbia comprehensive strategic partnership to a higher level. Hubei Media Group: Itâs reported that US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns said at the Brookings Institution on December 15 that China has a wish to become more influential in the Middle East, but the work to end the conflict is really on USâ shoulders. Whatâs your comment? Wang Wenbin: Since the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out, China has been committed to promoting a ceasefire, protecting the civilians and easing the humanitarian crisis. President Xi Jinping attended the BRICS extraordinary virtual summit on the Palestinian-Israeli issue, sent congratulatory messages to the UN special commemorative meeting in observance of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People for 11 consecutive years, and stated Chinaâs position on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict on multiple occasions. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi has had in-depth exchange of views with leaders and senior officials of more than 20 countries and international organizations and traveled to New York to chair the UN Security Council high-level meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli question. Chinaâs Special Envoy for the Middle East issue visited countries across the region, attended international conferences and widely engaged relevant countries. As the president of the Security Council in November, China enabled the adoption of the first Security Council resolution since the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out, submitted the Position Paper of the Peopleâs Republic of China on Resolving the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict and worked to galvanize more support and action from the Security Council. China has provided multiple batches of aid, including humanitarian cash assistance, food and medicine, to the people in Gaza. I want to stress that China does not have selfish interests in the Middle East and does not seek to form exclusive blocs in the region. China always supports the people in Middle East countries in keeping the regionâs future in their own hands. China stands ready to work with Arab-Islamic countries to firmly support the Palestinian peopleâs just cause of restoring their lawful national rights. In recent years, China has proposed a five-point initiative on achieving security and stability in the Middle East, a four-point proposal for the political settlement of the Syrian issue, and a three-point vision for the implementation of the two-state solution to the Palestinian question. China successfully hosted the Saudi Arabia-Iran talks in Beijing which produced major outcomes. All the efforts are aimed to encourage regional countries to seek strength through solidarity and resolve disputes and differences through dialogue and consultation. China will continue to work relentlessly to that end with the international community. The international community has been calling more strongly for a ceasefire. The UN General Assembly has adopted two resolutions with an overwhelming majority. We hope the US will listen to the voice of the international community, stop single-handedly blocking Security Council resolutions, and play its due role to promote an immediate ceasefire and prevent an even larger humanitarian catastrophe.  Bloomberg: The US military commander in the Indo-Pacific has said that China has reduced the number of the so-called âdangerous fighter jet interceptsâ against US aircraft since the summit meeting between President Biden and President Xi Jinping last month. Can you respond to thatï¼ Wang Wenbin: I refer you to competent Chinese authorities for the specifics. Let me say more broadly that China is firmly opposed to the frequent close-in reconnaissance conducted by US warships and aircraft around Chinaâs airspace and waters. We urge the US to stop those dangerous activities which threaten and undermine Chinaâs security and heighten the risk of regional conflict. CCTV: Itâs reported that on December 14, the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing the Chinese governmentâs forced assimilation of Tibetan children through boarding schools in Xizang, and called on the European Union and its member states to take actions. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Wang Wenbin: We have noted relevant reports. Whatâs said in the relevant resolution of the European Parliament is disinformation. It smears Chinaâs image and interferes in Chinaâs internal affairs. We deplore and strongly oppose this. We urge the European Parliament to stop spreading disinformation, stop using Xizang-related issues to interfere in Chinaâs internal affairs and stop all words and deeds that might undermine the mutual trust and cooperation between China and Europe. Xizang now enjoys a booming economy, harmonious and stable society, and effective protection and promotion of cultural heritage. The rights and freedoms of all ethnic groups, including the freedom of religious belief and the freedom to use and develop their own spoken and written languages, are fully protected. The human rights conditions in Xizang are better than ever, as witnessed by the international community. In the case of Xizang, due to highly scattered population, children have to travel long distances to get to school, which is very inconvenient. If schools were to be built in every place the students live, it would be very difficult to ensure adequate teachers and quality of teaching in each school. That is why local governments set up boarding schools according to actual needs to ensure all childrenâs equal right to education. It is entirely up to the students and their parents whether to go to boarding schools or not. Students can choose to go home on every weekend, holiday and festival, as well as during the winter and summer breaks. Parents can visit their children at school any time and take their children home whenever needed. Besides, relevant schools open courses of traditional culture, such as Tibetan language and literature and folk dance, provided traditional food unique to the Xizang Plateau, and students are allowed to wear traditional dresses at school. The European Parliamentâs attacks and smears against these boarding schools in Xizang are actually a kind of violation of the childrenâs right to education, which is damaging to the human rights conditions in Xizang. In recent years, in European countries, we have seen growing violation of the rights of refugees and migrants, growing xenophobia and racism, inadequate attention to economic, social and cultural rights as well as the right to development, and selective application and double standards when it comes to freedom of the press and forced labor. If the European Parliament truly cares about human rights, it should address Europeâs own issues first and pay attention to human rights violations in places like Gaza, rather than apply double standard and selective negligence, and instrumentalize and weaponize the human rights issue.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on December 18, 2023"," At the invitation of Premier of the State Council Li Qiang, Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Mikhail Mishustin will be in China from December 19 to 20 for the 28th regular meeting between Chinese and Russian heads of government. Yonhap News Agency: The Foreign Ministry put out a readout on the meeting between Chinaâs Foreign Minister Wang Yi and the DPRKâs Deputy Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho this morning. Can you share more details about the meeting? Wang Wenbin: This morning, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi in Beijing met with Deputy Foreign Minister of the DPRK Pak Myong Ho who came to China for diplomatic consultations between the two countries. Foreign Minister Wang Yi noted that the traditional friendship between China and the DPRK were forged and fostered personally by the older generation of leaders of the two parties and two countries, and is a valuable asset for both sides. In recent years, under the strategic guidance and personal care of the top leaders of the two parties and two countries, the China-DPRK traditional friendship has been further deepened in the new era. In a world fraught with change and instability, China and the DPRK have firmly supported and trusted each other, which demonstrates the strategic significance of China-DPRK friendship and cooperation. China always views its relations with the DPRK from a strategic height and long-term perspective. We would like to work with the DPRK to enhance communication and coordination, deepen exchanges and cooperation in various areas, jointly hold a number of events next year in commemoration of the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties, and advance the sustained and steady growth of China-DPRK friendship and cooperation. Deputy Foreign Minister Pak Myong Ho noted that it is the unswerving position of the party and government of the DPRK to continue to deepen the DPRK-China relations in line with the noble will of the top leaders of the two parties and two countries as well as the requirements of the new era. The DPRK stands ready to work with China to take the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties as an opportunity to consolidate the brotherly friendship between the two countries and take the relations forward. The DPRK will continue to enhance coordination with China on multilateral affairs, safeguard the common interests of the two countries and contribute to peace and stability in the region. The two sides also exchanged views on issues of mutual interest. Xinhua News Agency: Can you share the arrangement of the 28th regular meeting between Chinese Premier and Russian Prime Minister? Whatâs Chinaâs expectation for the meeting? Wang Wenbin: The regular meeting between Chinese Premier and Russian Prime Minister is an important mechanism for delivering on the common understandings between the two presidents and coordinating practical cooperation in various fields. It has been held annually since its launch in 1996. During this yearâs meeting, the two sides will have in-depth exchanges of views on bilateral relations, practical cooperation and issues of mutual interest. Under the strategic guidance of President Xi Jinping and President Putin, China-Russia relations have enjoyed sound and steady growth. Next year, the two countries will mark the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties and open the years of culture between China and Russia. We hope this regular meeting will help deepen cooperation, enhance cultural, people-to-people and sub-national exchange, and further grow the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era.  CCTV: Itâs reported that the first vice-ministerial level meeting of the China-Saudi Arabia-Iran trilateral joint committee was held on December 15 in Beijing. Could you share more information? Why is it held at this particular time? What is the significance of the meeting? Wang Wenbin: The first vice-ministerial level meeting of the China-Saudi Arabia-Iran trilateral joint committee was held on December 15 in Beijing. The meeting took stock of the positive progress made in the relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran since the Beijing agreement was reached and reaffirmed the commitment to the full implementation of the Beijing agreement. China stated readiness to continue to play a constructive role and support the improvement of Saudi Arabia-Iran relations. Director Wang Yi had a group meeting with the delegations from the two countries and put forward a three-point suggestion on the improvement of Saudi Arabia-Iran relations: first, stay committed to the strategic choice of reconciliation; second, advance the process of improving relations; and third, reject external disruption. The three parties also discussed the trilateral cooperation in various fields and stated their common positions on regional hotspot issues including Palestine. The recent situation in the Middle East is complex and serious. In times like this, it is all the more necessary to resolve disputes and differences through dialogue, consultation and political means. The future of the Middle East must always be in the hands of the people in the region. China will always support the people in the Middle East in independently exploring their development paths. We will always support Middle East countries in uniting and working together to find solutions to the security issues in the region. China will continue to contribute its insights to the peace and tranquility in the Middle East and play our positive role in this process. AFP: North Korea today fired its most advanced ballistic missile that has the potential to reach the US. Whatâs Chinaâs comment on this? Wang Wenbin: China noted the latest development on the Korean Peninsula. The Korean Peninsula issues are complex. The development of the situation fully proves that trying to solve the problem through military deterrence and pressuring will not work, and will only do the opposite and make the issues and tensions worse. Dialogue and consultation is the fundamental way for settling the Peninsula issues. We hope that relevant parties will face up to the crux of the Peninsula issues and take concrete steps to advance their political settlement and safeguard peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. Kyodo News: Japan and ASEAN countries held a summit in Tokyo this weekend and issued a joint statement announcing the strengthening of security cooperation. Whatâs Chinaâs comment?â Wang Wenbin: China believes that all cooperation should be conducive to deeper mutual trust between countries in the region and should not target any third party. The situation in the East and South China Seas is generally stable at the moment. We hope relevant countries will earnestly respect regional countriesâ effort to safeguard peace and stability.  China Review News: The trial of Jimmy Lai under the Hong Kong national security law opened today. The US and the UK criticized China over the case and the Hong Kong national security law. Whatâs your comment? Wang Wenbin: Hong Kong follows the rule of law. Any law in Hong Kong must be observed and those who break the law must be held accountable. Jimmy Lai is a major mastermind and participant of the anti-China riots in Hong Kong. He is an agent and pawn of the anti-China forces, and the person behind the riots in Hong Kong. What he did was detrimental to Hong Kongâs prosperity and stability and the wellbeing of the people in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong law enforcement and judicial authorities have handled and tried the case in accordance with the law. This is fully justified, legitimate and lawful. As for the USâ and UKâs statements, making such irresponsible comments on an ongoing judicial process is against the principle of the rule of law, the international law and the basic norms governing international relations. This is politically motivated and one hundred percent double standard. China firmly rejects this. The Central Government firmly supports the Hong Kong SAR in upholding national security in accordance with the law and bringing criminals who endanger national security to justice. Attempts to smear, disturb and sabotage Hong Kongâs national security law will not succeed. Reuters: Does China support North Koreaâs launch of the missiles on Sunday and Monday? This is given North Korea said that the recent arrival of a nuclear-powered US submarine is a preview of a nuclear war.â Wang Wenbin: I just stated Chinaâs position on relevant issue. All parties need to face the crux of the Korean Peninsula issues squarely and take concrete steps to advance their political settlement and safeguard peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. The Paper: Itâs reported that the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Saturday that the US State Department has approved a USD 300 million sale of life cycle support and equipment to Taiwan for its Command, Control, Communications and Computers, or C4, capabilities. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Wang Wenbin: By announcing another arms sale to Chinaâs Taiwan region, the USâhas blatantly violated the one-China principle and the stipulations of the three China-US joint communiquÃ©s, especially the August 17 CommuniquÃ©.âThis move seriously undermines Chinaâs sovereignty and security interests, harms peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and sends a wrong message to separatist forces seeking âTaiwan independenceâ. China deplores and strongly opposes this and has made solemn dÃ©marches to the US side. The Taiwan question is entirely Chinaâs internal affair that brooks no foreign interference. No matter how many weapons the US provides to the Taiwan region, it will neither change the historic course of Chinaâs reunification, nor weaken the Chinese peopleâs firm will in safeguarding our national sovereignty and territorial integrity. We urge the US to seriously honor its commitment to one-China and not supporting âTaiwan independenceâ, stop arming Taiwan and causing a dangerous trend, stop creating factors that could heighten tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and stop conniving at and supportingâtheâseparatistsâ attempt to seek âTaiwan independenceâ by force. China will and must be reunited. China will take resolute and strong measures to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity and take countermeasures against relevant companies involved in arms sales to Taiwan.  Beijing Youth Daily: US Secretary of State Blinken issued a statement on Dec 15 saying that the US rejects Chinaâs attempt to use cash awards to threaten and harass âthose advocating freedom and democracyâ and urges Hong Kong authorities to respect the protected rights and freedoms enumerated in the Basic Law. Does China have any response? Wang Wenbin: We firmly oppose US slandering of the National Security Law for Hong Kong and interference in the rule of law of the Hong Kong SAR. Those anti-China rioters who have fled overseas are suspected of endangering national security. Based on facts and in accordance with the law, the Hong Kong SAR issued arrest warrants for these fugitives. This is the right thing to do and is in line with the international law and customary practice. The USâ own national security legislation also has extraterritorial effect. By bolstering the rioters from Hong Kong, the US has not only trampled the rule of law in Hong Kong but also once again exposed its long-standing double standards on human rights and the rule of law. Hong Kong affairs are purely Chinaâs internal affairs that brook no external interference. We urge the US to reflect on its own behavior and respect Chinaâs sovereignty and rule of law in Hong Kong. The US shouldnât be a haven for criminals. China is determined to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests. The attempts to interfere in Hong Kongâs affairs and undermine the rule of law in Hong Kong will not succeed. China News Service: Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said in an interview on December 16 that a more assertive China posed a real challenge to its neighbors in Asia; the South China Sea situation is the most complex geopolitical challenge that the world faces; the Philippines and Japan are having increasing collaboration and should carry out trilateral cooperation with the US. What is Chinaâs response to this? Wang Wenbin: Over the past few months, it has been the Philippines who is breaching the common understandings with China and heightening tensions in the South China Sea; it is the Philippines who has attempted to change the current status of Renâai Jiao and make it a fait accompli; and it is the Philippines who has on every occasion courted external forces to put pressure on China. No matter what smokescreen the Philippines uses and what blame game it plays, nothing will change those facts: The Philippines promised to tow away the warship illegally grounded at Renâai Jiao 24 years ago. But 24 years on, the warship is still there. China and the Philippines had agreed to properly manage the issue of Renâai Jiao and thereby kept things stable at sea. However, over the course of this year, the Philippines has gone back on its words and kept sending government and military vessels into the waters of Renâai Jiao to supply construction materials for the large-scale repair and reinforcement of the âgroundedâ warship and permanently occupy Renâai Jiao. This is what has caused tensions between China and the Philippines. The Philippines, bolstered by external support, has brushed aside Chinaâs goodwill and restraint and repeatedly challenged Chinaâs principles and red line. This is the major risk that could drive up tensions at sea. China remains committed to upholding peace and stability in the South China Sea through dialogue and consultation with the Philippines and other ASEAN countries. That being said, China will not weaken in its resolve to safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. We hope the Philippines will realize that tying itself to some major power and forcing China to back down on issues concerning Chinaâs core interests will lead nowhere. Ultimately, it is the Philippinesâ own interests and the regionâs peace and stability that will take the toll. "
"âForeign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference onâDecember 15, 2023"," CCTV:âWe noted that General Secretary and President Xi Jinping successfully concluded his state visit to Viet Nam. Can youâfurtherâbrief us on the visit andâitsâimportant outcomes? Mao Ning:âFrom December 12 to 13, General Secretary and President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Viet Nam upon invitation. Foreign Minister Wang Yiâgaveâa detailedâoverview ofâthe visit andâitsâimportant outcomes. As the most important political agenda for China-Viet Nam relations this year, this successful visit is of great historic significance and marks a new milestone in the relations between the two parties and countries. The Vietnamese side attached great importance to this visit. The warm receptionâextendedâby Viet Nam wasâunprecedentedâandâof the highest level. The international media closely followedâthe visit and widely believe that this visit to Viet Nam is of significance to the region and beyond, and willâhave an importantâand far-reaching impact on the growth of relations between the two parties and countries, as well as on the whole region and even the global landscape. Three highlights of the visit are as follows: First, the China-Viet Nam relations are brought to a new level. The highlight moment of the visit isâwhenâleaders of the two parties and the two countries made the major historic decision to build a China-Viet Nam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance. During the visit, General Secretary Xi Jinping and General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Viet Nam (CPV) Nguyen Phu Trong held long, in-depth strategic communication and heart-to-heart talks as comrades to share governance experience. Both sides agreed that the two parties and countries should grasp the special strategic significance of China-Viet Nam relations from the height of strengthening world socialist forces and ensuring the steady advancement of the two countriesââsocialism causes. The two General Secretaries set the new characterization of the relations between the two parties and two countries, and announcedâthe decisionâto build a China-Viet Nam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance on the basis of deepeningâtheâChina-Viet Nam comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. As the most important political outcome of the visit, the new characterization is a continuation and buildup of the 15-year-long China-Viet Nam comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. It is a natural resultâthat echoesâthe trend of the times and serves theâfundamentalâinterests of the two countries and two peoples. The China-Viet Nam relationshipâis now inâa newâphaseâwith new goalsâand new impetus.â General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong and other Vietnamese leaders stated clearly that the Belt and Road Initiative, the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Global Civilization Initiative and other important global initiatives proposed by President Xi Jinping aim to safeguard humanityâs common interest. The Vietnamese side firmly supports and will actively participate in these initiatives. The Vietnamese side emphasized that China is the only country thatâcan contribute toâallâtheâpriorities of Vietnamese diplomacy and growing relations with China is the top priority and strategic choice made by Viet Nam, which will not be disturbed or sabotaged by any external forces. This sets a solid political foundation for building a China-Viet Nam community with a shared future. Second, practical cooperation produced new results. General Secretary Xi Jinping and General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong identified sixâgoalsâfor China-Viet Nam relations under new circumstances, namely stronger political mutual trust, more substantial security cooperation, deeper practical cooperation, more solidâpublicâsupportâfor bilateral relations, closer coordination and collaboration on multilateral issues and better solutions for managing differences. Concrete steps were also proposed to realize thoseâgoals. During the visit, the two sides signed more than 30 cooperation agreements, covering the Belt and Road Initiative, development cooperation, digital economy, green development, transportation, inspection and quarantine, defense and law enforcement cooperation,âandâmaritime cooperation, etc. During the visit, President Xi Jinping elaborated on the intrinsic requirements and distinctive features of Chinese modernization. He pointed out thatâmodernization of the over 1.4 billion Chinese people is a huge opportunity for the world;âThe remarkable development achievements of China and Viet Nam are a result of an open and inclusive world, especially a peaceful and stable Asia Pacific; China and Viet Nam need to step up coordination on multilateral affairs, uphold true multilateralism, safeguard the global free trade system andâbuild safe, secure, stable, unimpeded, efficient, open and inclusive global industrial and supply chains that benefit all. These important common understandings added new dimensions to the China-Viet Nam comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership and will produce a more solid material foundation for the building of a China-Viet Nam community with a shared future. Third,âa new chapter was written for the traditional friendship between China and Viet Nam. General Secretary Xi Jinping noted thatâit is important to take a systematic approach to advance people-to-people friendship between China and Viet Nam;âChina-Viet Nam cooperation needs to be weighted toward livelihood areas;âThe two sides should step up cooperation on youth and at subnational levels.âThe two General Secretaries and their wives took time out of their tight schedule to jointly meet with over 400ârepresentatives of young Chinese and Vietnamese and people who have contributed to China-Viet Nam friendship, during which they encouraged the youthsâof the two countries toâcarry forward China-Viet Nam friendship, playâtheirâpart in promoting the development of the Asia Pacific, andâbe pioneers in promoting human progress. We believe that under the strategic guidance of the top leaders of the two parties and with the joint support from people of all sectors of the two countries, the traditional friendship between China and Viet Nam will be passed from generation to generation, keep flourishing, and provide a solid public foundation for the building of a community with a shared future that carries strategic significance. General Secretary and President Xi Jinpingâs state visit to Viet Nam is a great success. It is yet another vivid example of China pursuing neighborhood diplomacy featuring amity, sincerity, mutual benefit and inclusiveness, and another successful practice of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy. China and all Indo-China Peninsula countries have been committed to building a community with a shared future both bilaterally and multilaterally under the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation mechanism. This represents an important and substantive progress in buildingâa community with a shared future withâourâneighbors, and also another important step in building a community with a shared future for mankind. The visit marks a successful ending for this yearâs overseas trips by Chinaâs head of state which are full of highlights, and promises another year of fruitful diplomacy of China. AFP:âHong Kong police yesterday issued arrest warrants for five overseas-basedâactivistsâaccused of national security crimes. US officials expressed strong condemnation. The UK Foreign Secretary called the moveââa threat to our democracy and fundamental human rightsâ. Whatâs your comment? Mao Ning: We strongly deplore and firmly opposeâcertainâcountriesâ flagrant slandering against the national security law for Hong Kong and interference in the rule of law in the Hong Kong SAR. Theâfive anti-China rioters who have fled overseasâare suspected of endangering national security. The Hong Kong police issued arrest warrants for these destabilizing elements in accordance with the law. This is a necessary and legitimate act that is in line with the international law and customary practice. National security laws of other countries, including the US and the UK, also have extraterritorial effect. The five destabilizingâelementsâengage in acts that endanger national security under the pretext of democracy and human rights. The US and the UK by endorsing and supporting these people have exposed their ill intention of destabilizing Hong Kong. I want to stress that Hong Kong is Chinaâs Hong Kong. Hong Kong affairs are purely Chinaâs internal affairsâthat brook no external interference.âChina is determined to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests. Relevant countries should respect Chinaâs sovereignty and the rule of law in Hong Kong and stop interfering in Chinaâs internal affairs.  TASS: Russian President Vladimir Putin said yesterday at the Direct Line call-in show and the press conference that the cooperation between Russia and China have reachedâanâunprecedented level. He stressed that Russia and China have cooperation in military, economic and humanitarian fields, but will not establish any alliance or target any third country. Whatâs the Foreign Ministryâs comment? Mao Ning: We noted and appreciate President Putinâs positive remarks on China-Russia relations. Under the strategic guidance of the two presidents, China-Russia relationship has maintained sound and steady growth. The two sides always uphold the principle of non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting of any third party and advance bilateral relations and cooperation in various fields on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, bringing tangible benefits to the two peoples and playing a positive role in advancing global common development. Global Times:âAccording to reports, the Presidential Administration of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Armenia issued a joint statement on December 7 saying thatâthe two countries reconfirm their intention to normalize relations and to reach the peace treaty on the basis of respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity. The joint statement said thatâtheâtwo countriesâhaveâreachedâan agreement on taking tangible steps towards building confidence and will continue their discussions regarding the implementation of more confidence building measures. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning:âBoth Azerbaijan and Armenia are friendly cooperative partners of China. We sincerely hope that the two sides will workâwith each otherâto address their differences and disputes through dialogue andâconsultation, safeguard regional peace and stability andâensure their people can live in peace. AFP: US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen yesterday called on China to shift its economic policy, saying thatââtoo strong a role for state-owned enterprises can choke growth and an excessive role for the security apparatus can dissuade investment.ââWhatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: China believesâkeepingâChina-US economic and trade tiesâsound and stableâis conducive to our two countries and the wider world. We stand ready to work with the US to uphold the principle of mutual respect, peaceful co-existence and win-win cooperation,âdeliver onâthe common understandings reached at the San Francisco summit and advance the sound and steady development of bilateral economic and trade relations. Meanwhile, we also hope that the USâwill honorâits wordsâinstead of sanctioning Chinese companies whileâclaiming it wantsâcooperation and wonât decoupleâwith China.  NHK: Are there any casualties concerning foreign citizens in the subway accident on the Changping line in Beijing that happened last night? Mao Ning: Relevant department of Beijing has released information concerning the subway accident on the Changping line. We are collecting information about whether there are casualties concerning foreign citizens.â AFP: ASEAN and Japanese leaders will hold talks this weekend. According to the draft of the final statement, they are expected to enhance security cooperation, including on maritime issues. What is Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: China believes that all cooperation should help enhance mutual trust between countries in the region, promote common development, and contribute to the regionâs peace and stability. No cooperation should target any third party. TASS: Russian President Putin also said yesterday that âwe see attempts by the West to shift NATO activities to Asia and towards Asia, which clearly go beyond the charter goals of this organization.â What is the Foreign Ministryâs comment? Mao Ning: NATOâs attempt to make eastward inroads into the Asia-Pacific is not consistent with its mandate as a regional defensive organization and will only bring bloc confrontation into Asia and sabotage regional peace and stability.âThe China-Russia relationship rises above the model of military and political alliance in the Cold War era and is fundamentally different from the exclusive groupings and bloc confrontation practiced by NATO.  The following question was raised after the press conference: On December 14 local time, Guyanese President Irfaan Ali and Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro held a meeting in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to exchange views on territorial disputes between the two countries. The two sides reached consensus over avoiding escalated conflict and dispute and using peaceful means to address differences. The two sides agreed to keep the momentum of dialogue on the issue of Essequibo. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: I noted the reports. Guyana and Venezuela are both good friends of China. China is glad to see Guyanese President Irfaan Ali and Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro have direct talks on the territorial disputes between the two countries which produced positive progress. We commend the effort made by relevant countries and organizations in Latin America and the Caribbean. China always supports Guyana and Venezuela in properly settling the delimitation of their boundaries through friendly consultation. This is in line with the interests of the peoples of the two countries and conducive to stability, cooperation and development of Latin America and the Caribbean."
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on December 14, 2023"," China News Service: It is reported that COP28 in Dubai has reached an agreement, and the representatives of Contracting Parties have concluded the first Global Stocktake aimed at realizing the targets of the UNFCCC. Simon Stiell, UN Climate Change Executive Secretary, said in his closing speech to the Conference that the agreement signals âthe beginning of the endâ of the fossil fuel era. What is Chinaâs comment on the outcomes? What role will China play in implementing the outcomes of the Conference? Mao Ning: After two weeks of tough negotiations and one day into overtime, the UN COP28 in Dubai was concluded on December 13. The Conference finished the first-ever Global Stocktake since the Paris Agreement took effect, reviewed the past progress and gaps, and charted the course for the further implementation of the Paris Agreement. In particular, this milestone Conference has consolidated the trend of global green and low carbon transition. The success of the Conference reflects the strong consensus of all parties on the urgency of addressing climate change issues. Its outcomes sent out a message of multilateralism and tackling climate change with greater solidarity and stronger action. COP28 reaffirmed the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. The Conference adopted on its first day the decision on the Loss and Damage Fund which developing countries cared deeply about. The Conference also adopted other major decisions including the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) Framework, the Just Transition Work Program, among others. That being said, no substantial progress has been made in fulfilling the pledges made by developed countries of taking the lead in reducing emissions, and providing support of capital, technology and capacity building to developing countries. The issue of unilateral measures hindering international cooperation has not yet been properly resolved. To build a global climate governance system that is fair, reasonable, cooperative and win-win remains an uphill task. China attaches high importance to COP28. President Xi Jinpingâs Special Representative, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Ding Xuexiang attended the World Climate Action Summit and the G77 plus China Summit on climate change and delivered remarks. During COP28, China fully participated in consultations on all topics and coordinated closely with the UAE, the chair of COP28, and other parties to firmly uphold the common interest of developing countries. China also provided solutions for negotiations on key issues, engaged parties to seek common ground while resolving differences and made important contribution to shaping positive outcomes. Going forward, China will stay committed to the path of Chinese modernization featuring harmony between man and nature, continue to actively advance international cooperation on addressing climate change and work with all parties to promote the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and together build a clean, beautiful world. Reuters: Several senior staff at a German auditor distance themselves from audit conducted by that firm of a Volkswagen joint venture plant in Xinjiang. They found no evidence of forced labor there. The firm later said that besides a small number of staff, no other employees participated in, supported or backed this project. Whatâs Chinaâs response? Mao Ning: The so-called âforced laborâ in Xinjiang is a lie that has been debunked by facts and truth.  Hubei Media Group: US National Security Council member Joshua Geltzer said that Section 702 of the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), an important legal basis for US intelligence authorities to eavesdrop on non-US citizens overseas and step up international surveillance without authorization, will expire on December 31. It was estimated that nearly 60 percent of President Bidenâs daily intelligence brief came from these âbig earsâ. What is Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: The US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), adopted after Watergate, was originally aimed at preventing government authorities from abusing power and carrying out arbitrary eavesdropping. However, Section 702, added in 2008, permit the National Security Agency to carry out eavesdropping and surveillance without obtaining an individualized court order. After that, the US government has been expanding the scope of eavesdropping and surveillance to interfere in other countriesâ internal affairs and meddle in the normal course of international affairs. This runs counter to international law and basic norms governing international relations. The more targets the US spies on, the fewer friends it has. The US needs a better sense of boundary and less obsession for control. China Review News: It is reported that the launching ceremony of the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) which is being built by a Chinese company was held in Kuantan, capital of Pahang. The Head of State of Malaysia Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah officially launched the track laying for the project at the ceremony. What is your comment? Mao Ning: The East Coast Rail Link is a landmark of the Belt and Road cooperation between China and Malaysia. It is also one of the largest single transportation infrastructure projects built overseas by Chinese companies. The project now is making smooth progress, with over half being completed. When fully completed, the railway will be the first of its kind that links the east and west coasts of Malaysia, and improve connectivity along the railway.â This year marks the 10th anniversary of both the BRI and the establishment of China-Malaysia comprehensive strategic partnership. This March, President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim reached important common understandings on jointly building a China-Malaysia community with a shared future, opening a new chapter in China-Malaysia relations. The bilateral Belt and Road cooperation has borne fruitful results, including Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park and Kuantan Port, which, along with Port Klang, are to be connected by the ECRL. Next year will see the 50th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral ties. We hope that the two sides can further deepen bilateral practical cooperation in various fields and bring more benefits to the two peoples. AFP: According to its officials, the Philippines deported 180 Chinese nationals today, saying they did not have work permits and had been âengaging in online scamsâ. Could China provide more information? Mao Ning: The Chinese government always asks Chinese nationals overseas to observe local laws and regulations. We also hope the Philippines can take earnest measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese nationals.â Reuters: South Koreaâs military said it scrambled fighter jets when two Chinese and four Russian military planes entered its air defence zone today. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: It is learned that the Chinese military aircraft were carrying out routine and conventional flight activities in international air space. This is in compliance with international law.  The following question was raised after the press conference: Itâs reported that Myanmar military spokesperson said Myanmarâs government, facilitated by China, held talks with the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Taâang National Liberation Army and the Arakan Army. Can you confirm this and whatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: China supports the peace process of the northern Myanmar and has provided support and facilitation for dialogue and contact between relevant parties in Myanmar. Since fighting broke out on October 27 in northern Myanmar, China has been making relentless efforts to promote talks to end the fighting and deescalate the situation. With Chinaâs mediation effort, Myanmarâs military recently held peace talks with the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Taâang National Liberation Army and the Arakan Army in China and reached agreement on a number of arrangements, including the temporary ceasefire and maintaining the momentum of dialogue. The conflict in northern Myanmar has been notably deescalating, which not only serves the interest of relevant parties in Myanmar but also helps ensure peace and tranquility at the China-Myanmar border area. China hopes that relevant parties in Myanmar can speed up efforts to implement what has been agreed, exercise maximum restraint, actively ease the situation on the ground, promptly manage sporadic confrontation events and together realize the soft landing of the situation in northern Myanmar."
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on December 13, 2023"," At the invitation of the President of the Republic of Madagascar Andry Nirina Rajoelina, President Xi Jinpingâs Special Envoy and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Peopleâs Political Consultative Conference Hu Chunhua will attend the inauguration of President Rajoelina in Madagascarâs capital Antananarivo on December 16. CCTV: General Secretary and President Xi Jinping started his state visit to Viet Nam yesterday. The leaders of the two countries jointly announced a new characterization of the relationship for the two parties and two countries. Can you share more information with us? Mao Ning: General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and President Xi Jinping is in Viet Nam for a state visit. General Secretary Xi Jinping and General Secretary of the Communist Party of Viet Nam Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong held talks and jointly witnessed the signing of cooperation documents between the two sides. President Xi Jinping also met or held talks with Viet Namâs State President Vo Van Thuong, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and Chairman of the National Assembly Vuong Dinh Hue. General Secretary Xi Jinping and General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong jointly announced a new characterization of the relationship for the two parties and two countries, working together for a China-Viet Nam community with a shared future that carries strategic significance on the basis of deepening the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. The two General Secretaries agree that China and Viet Nam, as close and friendly neighbors, share the same aspiration and philosophy. As good neighbors, good partners, good brothers, and good comrades, China and Viet Nam have unique advantages of following the trend of the times, geographic proximity and shared cultural affinity in building a community with a shared future that carries strategic significance. The two sides should carry forward the traditional friendship forged by older-generation leaders, build a community with a shared future together, and make steady progress in their modernization drives, so as to achieve win-win outcomes and common success, benefit the two peoples, and contribute to regional peace and prosperity. China and Viet Nam are both socialist countries and neighbors with time-honored friendship. In 2008, the two countries established the comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. The new characterization of China-Viet Nam relationship is a continuation, buildup and upgrading of the 15 years of comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. It is a natural result in line with the trend of the times, serves the common interests of the two parties, two countries and two peoples, and meets the strategic need of revitalizing the worldâs socialist cause. We believe that with concerted efforts of both sides, the China-Viet Nam relations will enter a new stage that enjoys deeper political mutual trust, more substantive security cooperation, deeper mutually beneficial cooperation, a more solid public foundation, closer coordination on multilateral affairs, better management of differences, and joint efforts for new achievements in the socialist development of the two countries. China News Service: UK Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs David Cameron reportedly met with Sebastien Lai, the son of Jimmy Lai, on the night of December 12 local time. The UK side said it opposes the Hong Kong National Security Law and will continue to stand by Jimmy Lai and the people of Hong Kong. During a recent visit to the US, David Cameron also said that the world has changed a lot, China has become much more aggressive, and they must offer other countries an alternative to China rather than leave them to the mercy of Chinese debt traps and better protect themselves from Chinaâs cyber attacks and other hostile acts. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: Itâs public knowledge that Jimmy Lai is one of the most notorious anti-China elements bent on destabilizing Hong Kong and a mastermind of the riots that took place in Hong Kong. He blatantly colluded with external forces to undermine Chinaâs national security and is responsible for numerous egregious acts. The Hong Kong SAR took action to hold him accountable in accordance with the law. This is beyond reproach. The UK apparently considers itself a country based on the rule of law, but it is now openly interfering in an ongoing judicial process. The UK has recently adopted its own National Security Bill, but it is now brazenly opposing Chinaâs national security legislation for Hong Kong. That says everything about the UKâs hypocrisy and hidden agenda. More than three years on since the Hong Kong National Security Law was adopted, more than 80 percent of people in Hong Kong believe the law has made Hong Kong safer. What the UK has done is laughably pointless, especially when Hong Kong has already restored order and is set to thrive. We ask the UK to respect facts and the rule of law and stop meddling in Hong Kongâs affairs, which are Chinaâs internal affairs. By calling China âaggressiveâ, the UK is misrepresenting facts. China follows an independent foreign policy of peace. We are a partner presenting opportunities to other countries, not a threat posing challenges. We are committed to developing relations with other countries on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit. At the same time, we will resolutely defend our sovereignty, security and development interests. The UKâs âdebt trapâ rhetoric is not based on facts. Chinaâs investment and financing cooperation with fellow developing countries is carried out in compliance with international rules, market laws and the principle of debt sustainability and has been widely welcomed. In fact, not a single cooperation partner has accused China of creating âdebt trapsâ. It is a handful of Western countries who have been spreading the fallacy of âChinese debt trapsâ. The multilateral financial institutions and commercial creditors these countries dominate are the major creditors of developing countries and constitute the major source of stress for them in terms of debt repayment. They are the ones that need to make substantive contributions to easing developing countriesâ debt burden. Cybersecurity is a global challenge. China firmly cracks down on cyber attacks and holds that cybersecurity needs to be jointly safeguarded by all countries through dialogue and cooperation. We oppose politicizing cybersecurity issues and smearing other countries without any factual basis. We call on the UK to reject the Cold War mentality, stop spreading âChina threatâ narratives, look at China and China-UK relations in an objective and rational light, and work with China for the sound and steady development of bilateral ties.â Reuters: According to reports in Argentinean media, Argentina has sent China a letter about the currency swap arrangement between Peopleâs Bank of China and Argentinean central bank. These reports say that China asked Argentina to clear up its stance towards China after Argentinean President Milei made anti-China remarks on his campaign trail. Could you confirm whether this is the case?â Mao Ning: On the currency swap arrangement between China and Argentina, Iâd refer you to competent Chinese authorities. On the relations between China and Argentina, we have previously stated our position. China and Argentina are both major developing countries and important emerging economies. The two countries are comprehensive strategic partners and our bilateral relations are in good shape. China values the growth of its relations with Argentina from a strategic and long-term perspective. We stand ready to work with the new government of Argentina for the sustained and steady development of the China-Argentina comprehensive strategic partnership.  AFP: A select committee of the US House of Representatives issued a report yesterday calling for a reset on the US-China economic relationship. What is Chinaâs response? Mao Ning: The committee you mentioned is obsessed with attacking and smearing China. It is biased and hostile and has no rationality to speak of. What they have said fully shows that some in the US are attempting to politicize and weaponize trade and tech issues between China and the US. We firmly oppose this. China-US economic and trade cooperation benefits both sides. There is no winner in a trade war or tariff war. Curbs and protectionism will only disrupt normal trade and destabilize industrial and supply chains. They do not serve the interests of any party. The US needs to earnestly respect the principles of market economy and international trade rules, and create a favorable environment for China-US economic and trade cooperation, rather than do the opposite. CRI: On December 10 local time, US State Department released a statement making groundless accusation against Chinaâs law enforcement measures in waters near Huangyan Dao and Renâai Jiao and threatening once again that the US Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty extends to the South China Sea. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: Iâve elaborated on the facts and Chinaâs position concerning the recent incidents in waters of Chinaâs Renâai Jiao and Iâll not go over it again. But what needs to be pointed out is that Huangyan Dao hasâalwaysâbeen part of Chinaâs territory and China has indisputable sovereignty over Huangyan Dao and its adjacent waters. On December 9, three official vessels of the Philippines, without permission from the Chinese side, intruded into adjacent waters ofâHuangyan Dao. China Coast Guard took necessary measures in accordance with the law, which were professional, restrained, lawful and legitimate. The US State Department, in disregard of the facts, issued a statement to groundlessly attack Chinaâs fully justified law enforcement activities to safeguard our rights at Renâai Jiao and Huangyan Dao. The statement is an attempt to endorse the Philippinesâ infringement of Chinese sovereignty and provocation. We firmly reject it. For some time, out of selfish geopolitical interests, the US has incited, supported and assisted in the Philippinesâ infringement and provocation at sea, and repeatedly made threats by citing the US Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty. Such moves blatantly embolden the Philippinesâ violation of Chinaâs sovereignty, seriously violate the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and gravely jeopardize regional peace and stability. China has made clear that the so-called arbitral award on the South China Sea is illegal, null and void, and has no binding effect whatsoever. The US itself would not implement the judgement of the International Court of Justice and international arbitral awards. In what position is the US to tell China that it should implement an illegal arbitral award? The US needs to know that no threat, coercion or unfounded attack and accusation will lead anywhere or shake Chinaâs firm resolve and will in safeguarding its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. China will continue to resolutely uphold its legitimate sovereignty and rights and interests in accordance with domestic and international law. The USâs attempts will not succeed.ââ Antara: The UN General Assembly has adopted a resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, but it is an unbinding resolution. How can China as a member state of Security Council use this resolution as the next step in the Security Council? Mao Ning: At the request of Arab and Islamic countries, the UN General Assembly held an emergency special session on the Palestinian question on December 12, which adopted a resolution tabled by Arab countries requesting an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, compliance with the obligations under international law, including international humanitarian law, notably with regard to the protection of civilians, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages as well as ensuring humanitarian access. This is the second time that the UNGA emergency special session voted overwhelmingly for a resolution on the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict, which reflects the strong international call for a ceasefire and what the world wants between war and peace.âChina fully supports the resolution. We co-sponsored and voted for it. We hope to see the full implementation of this resolution, ceasefire and end of hostilities as soon as possible, alleviation of the humanitarian crisis and restoration of peace and stability in the region. China stands ready to continue working with all parties to play a positive and constructive role in realizing lasting peace between Palestine and Israel through the two-state solution.  China Review News: According to reports, TEPCO made an announcement on December 11, confirming that a worker decommissioning the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plantâs No.2 reactor was contaminated with radioactive substances and radioactive materials may have been incorporated into the body due to exposure to internal radiation. What is Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: I noted the reports. During the decommissioning of Japanâs Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant and the handling of the nuclear-contaminated water, accidents have happened one after another involving workers being sprayed with nuclear-contaminated water or exposed to radioactive substances. This speaks to the seriousness of the problem and once again proves the vital importance of properly handling the nuclear-contaminated water. Japanâs discharge of the nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean is scheduled to last 30 years or even longer, and this poses enormous risks. China urges Japan to take seriously the concerns of stakeholders, fully cooperate in establishing an international monitoring arrangement that has the substantive participation of relevant parties and will remain effective over the long haul, and take concrete actions to avoid the long-term harm of the discharge to marine environment and peopleâs health. The Paper: We noted that the Supreme Court of India, at the request of some in India, made a verdict, upholding the validity of the order abrogating Article 370 of Constitution, asking the Indian government to restore the statehood in Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir at the earliest, and upholding the validity of the decision of the Indian government in 2019 to carve out the so-called union territory of Ladakh. What is Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: China has never recognized the so-called union territory of Ladakh set up unilaterally and illegally by India. Indiaâs domestic judicial verdict does not change the fact that the western section of the China-India border has always belonged to China. AFP: The COP28 Presidency released a proposed text of a final climate deal today. Can you share Chinaâs position on the text as well as this yearâs COP28? Mao Ning: We noted the progress of COP28 negotiations. COP28 is a very important conference. China has taken an active part in the discussion and negotiation on the agenda items and supports the host country the UAE in making the conference a success. We hope the outcomes of this meeting will contribute to the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and lend more support to developing countriesâ efforts to realize energy transition and better cope with climate change. Bloomberg: The US has sanctioned more than 250 companies and individuals in China, TÃ¼rkiye and the UAE over alleged support for Russia in its war efforts. Would the Foreign Ministry like to comment on this? Mao Ning: China opposes the USâs unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction. The US needs to correct its wrong practice and stop containing and going after Chinese companies. China will do what is necessary to firmly safeguard Chinese companiesâ lawful rights and interests.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on December 12, 2023"," CCTV: On December 11, Argentinaâs new President Javier Milei met with President Xi Jinpingâs Special Envoy and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Peopleâs Congress Wu Weihua. Could you share more details on that meeting? Mao Ning: At the invitation of the government of Argentina, President Xi Jinpingâs Special Envoy and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Peopleâs Congress Wu Weihua attended the inauguration of President of Argentina Javier Milei in Argentinaâs capital Buenos Aires. On December 11, President Javier Milei met with Wu Weihua.â Wu Weihua extended President Xi Jinpingâs warm congratulations and best wishes to President Javier Milei. President Javier Milei thanked President Xi for sending the special envoy to attend his inauguration, and asked Vice Chairman Wu to extend his sincere greetings and best wishes to President Xi. He stressed that the new government of Argentina attaches high importance to its relations with China and will continue to firmly follow the one-China principle and the Argentine side stands ready to further promote the in-depth exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in various fields including economy and trade and cultural and people-to-people exchanges.â Global Times: It is reported that IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath said on December 11 that around 3,000 trade restricting measures were imposed last year, nearly three times the number imposed in 2019. If the global economy fragments into two blocs, including predominantly the US and Europe in the Western bloc and China and Russia in the Eastern bloc, the global losses are estimated to be about 2.5 to 7 percent of global GDP. What is your comment? Mao Ning: Trade protectionism is not conducive to the free flow of factors including goods, services and capital, distorts resource allocation, and undermines consumersâ interests. It does no good to the production efficiency and the recovery and development of the world economy. What is concerning is that some countries have been pushing for decoupling and severing of supply chains under the pretext of security, and imposing trade restriction measures in the name of âde-riskingâ. This will only make the world even less safe and bring more risks. As President Xi Jinping stressed, in an increasingly interdependent and integrated world where countries form a community of shared interests, openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation are the only viable option. China is always committed to building an open world economy and steadfastly promoting high-level opening-up. We always believe that absence of cooperation is the biggest risk and failure to develop is the biggest security threat. China stands ready to work with all parties to realize common development and prosperity through equal consultation and mutually beneficial cooperation. Associated Press of Pakistan: On December 11, Indian Supreme Court announced a decision endorsing the Indian governmentâs unilateral step to change the status of Jammu and Kashmir region, which is a clear violation of UNSC Resolution 122 which decided that the final settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir issue can only take place by UN-supervised plebiscite. What is Chinaâs response? Mao Ning: Chinaâs position on the Kashmir issue is consistent and clear-cut. The Kashmir issue, left from the past, needs to be resolved peacefully and appropriately in accordance with the UN Charter, Security Council resolutions and relevant bilateral agreement. Parties concerned need to settle the dispute through dialogue and consultation so as to maintain regional peace and stability.  Bloomberg: Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the US will take the strongest possible action to protect national security when asked about how the Commerce Department will respond to Huaweiâs chip-making breakthroughs. Do you have any response to her comments? Mao Ning: We have made clear our position on US chip export controls targeting China on multiple occasions. Such abuse of export control measures seriously harms Chinese companiesâ legitimate rights and interests, destabilizes global chip industrial and supply chains, violates the principles of market economy and fair competition, and serves no oneâs interests. We firmly reject this. The US needs to act on its commitments of not seeking a decoupling from China and not seeking to halt Chinaâs economic development. We will be watching closely relevant developments and resolutely defend our legitimate rights and interests. Bloomberg: One more on Raimondo on a separate issue. She said the US is looking into specifics of three new AI accelerators that Nvidia is developing for China. Earlier this month she vowed to restrict any new chips that give the Asian country AI capabilities. Can you give any response to that? Mao Ning: We firmly oppose the USâs abuse of export controls and malicious attempts to blockade and keep down China. AFP: Chinaâs official media reported today that President Xi is now in Hanoi on a state visit to Viet Nam. Could you update us on this? Mao Ning: General Secretary and President Xi Jinping is paying a state visit to Viet Nam starting from today. More information on the visit will be released in a timely manner. Please check back for updates. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on December 11, 2023"," CCTV: On December 10, the Philippines sent vessels to intrude into waters of Renâai Jiao in Chinaâs Nansha Qundao in an attempt to send construction materials to the illegally grounded warship there. The mission was blocked by China Coast Guard. Afterwards, the Philippine President and the Philippine National Security Council blamed China. Do you have any comment? Mao Ning: On December 10, one cargo vessel, one official vessel and two coast guard ships of the Philippines, without permission from the Chinese government, intruded into adjacent waters ofâRenâai Jiao in Chinaâs Nansha Qundao in an attempt to send construction materials to the illegally grounded warship at the reef. In disregard of the warnings of the China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels, a Philippine vessel went headlong towards Renâai Jiaoâs lagoon and dangerously rammed a CCG ship on the scene. Thisâgravely violated Chinaâs sovereignty and jeopardized the safety of the Chinese ships and personnel. The CCG took necessary enforcement measures against the Philippine ship in accordance with domestic and international law, which were professional, restrained, justified and legitimate. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has lodged serious dÃ©marche in strong protest to the Philippine side.â I need to stress that Renâai Jiao is part of Chinaâs Nansha Qundao. China has indisputable sovereignty over Nansha Qundao, including Renâai Jiao, and their adjacent waters. This was established in the long course of history and is consistent with international law including the UN Charter. It is against the principles of international law and legally untenable for the Philippines to cite the âawardâ of the South China Sea arbitration, which is illegal, null and void, to claim that Renâai Jiao falls within its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf and deny Chinaâs sovereignty over it. The responsibility for the recent emergencies in waters of Renâai Jiao lies completely with the Philippines. The root cause is that the Philippines has broken its promise and refused to tow away the illegally grounded warship at the reef and attempted to reinforce it on a large scale in an attempt to permanently occupy Renâai Jiao. China firmly opposes the Philippinesâ attempt to occupy Renâai Jiao and has made clear its solemn position to the Philippine side at various levels and through multiple channels, demanding that the Philippines will not send construction materials to the illegally grounded warship for large-scale repair and reinforcement and putting forward proposals for properly managing the situation. However, the Philippine side, in disregard of Chinaâs goodwill, good faith and restraint, broke its promise and kept stirring up trouble by infringing on Chinaâs sovereignty and making provocative moves in waters of Renâai Jiao. It has also been spreading disinformation to hype up the incidents. This gravely violates international law and the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) and seriously infringes on Chinaâs territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. We once again urge the Philippines to stop infringing on Chinaâs sovereignty and making provocative moves, stop groundlessly attacking and smearing China, and avoid undermining peace and stability in the South China Sea. We will continue to do what is necessary in accordance with domestic and international laws to resolutely respond to provocative moves that infringe on Chinaâs sovereignty and defend our territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. NHK: Hong Kong held its first district council election guided by the principle of âpatriots administering Hong Kongâ on Sunday. Whatâs your comment? Mao Ning: The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council has already made remarks on the Council Ordinary Election of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), which you may refer to. The election was the first of its kind since the restructuring of the district council system in Hong Kong. The election was well-organized, orderly, fair and just, which demonstrates a new prospect of good governance under the principle of âpatriots administering Hong Kongâ. We are fully confident that the new district councils will perform their duties in accordance with the law and believe that the newly elected district council members will serve as a bridge between the HKSAR Government and the Hong Kong people and help the former improve the system of community-level governance and improve its effectiveness.  CCTV: Yesterday marks the Human Rights Day. Can you introduce Chinaâs achievements on protecting and promoting human rights? We also noted that a handful of Western countries have been attacking China under the pretext of human rights. Whatâs Chinaâs comment?â Mao Ning: On December 10, 1948, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a significant document in the history of human civilization. In 1950, the UNGA designated December 10 as Human Rights Day.ââ To commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, China held an International Symposium in Beijing. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the symposium and delivered a keynote speech, in which he elaborated on the important views of President Xi Jinping on human rights, Chinaâs human rights development path, and Chinaâs position and propositions on global human rights governance. The Beijing Declaration was issued at the symposium and received warm response. China holds a people-centered human rights philosophy and believes that a happy life for the people is the most important human right. We have built a moderately prosperous society in all respects, won the largest battle against poverty in human history and put in place the worldâs largest education, social security, and healthcare systems. We have been working to improve the living environment for our people, develop the whole-process peopleâs democracy, advance the rule of law for human rights and safeguard social equity and justice. China has found a path towards better human rights that follows the trend of the times and fits our national realities and made historic progress in our human rights cause. Promoting and protecting human rights is the common cause of mankind. No country in the world is in the position to act as a âpreacherâ on human rights. The most authoritative comment on a countryâs human rights conditions comes from its people. Countriesâ right to independently choosing human rights development paths needs to be respected. Certain countries, while ignoring their own serious human rights issues, have been interfering in other countriesâ internal affairs under the pretext of human rights. Such attempts reveal their double standards and hypocrisy. China will stay committed to advancing and protecting human rights, upholding the common values of humanity and engaging in human rights dialogue and cooperation based on equality and mutual respect. China will continue to work with all sides to protect human rights through security, support human rights through development and advance human rights through cooperation in a joint effort to promote the global human rights cause. Reuters: The Philippines on Monday has called actions of Chinese vessels against their boats in the South China Sea over the weekend a serious escalation. The Philippines has also this morning said that they are undeterred in protecting their sovereignty. Have the incidents between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea damaged bilateral ties and would diplomacy be of any use in improving the situation? Mao Ning: I have shared the facts and truth about what has happened. I would like to stress that the responsibility for the recent emergencies in waters of Renâai Jiao lies with the Philippines. The root cause is that the Philippines has broken its promise and refused to tow away the illegally grounded warship at the reef and tried to reinforce it in an attempt to permanently occupy Renâai Jiao. In light of the Philippinesâ repeated provocations and infringement at Renâai Jiao and its waters, China has been committed to enhancing communication with the Philippines with sincerity and good will to properly handle the situation. We have also put forward proposals on managing and controlling the situation at Renâai Jiao. The ball is now with the Philippine side. We hope the Philippines will face up to the root cause of the issue, stop making provocations and creating trouble, and safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea. China News Service: It was reported that the UN Security Council on December 8 voted on a resolution drafted by the UAE calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, but it was not adopted due to US veto. What is your comment? Mao Ning: Over the past two months since the outbreak of this round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Gaza has seen close to 20,000 civilians die from the fights and over one million people displaced. Ceasefire and end of hostilities is currently the top priority and reflects extensive international aspiration. Close to 100 countries, including China, co-sponsored the draft resolution tabled by the UAE representing Arab countries. We regret and are disappointed at the US vetoâthe only veto on the Security Council draft resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. Connivance at the conflict means heavier civilian casualties and worse humanitarian catastrophe, and will sow more seeds of hatred. On issues of war and peace, life and death, major countries with influence need to play a constructive role in helping end the fight, make utmost efforts to avoid civilian casualties, and stand on the side of peace and the side of life.  Dragon TV: According to reports, the EU Delegation in China issued a statement on December 10, reiterating concern over Chinaâs severe human rights situation and urging China to ârespect, protect and fulfil human rights for all, including Uyghurs, Tibetans and persons belonging to ethnic minorities across Chinaâ. It also mentions the death penalty and âpro-democracyâ activists. Whatâs Chinaâs comment?â Mao Ning: The EU statement contains groundless accusation on Chinaâs human rights conditions, spreads disinformation, tarnishes Chinaâs image and gravely violates Chinaâs internal affairs. China deplores and firmly opposes this and has made solemn dÃ©marches to the EU. China holds a people-centered approach and has scored historic achievements in protecting human rights. Xinjiang and Xizang have long enjoyed booming economy, harmonious and stable society, and effective protection and promotion of cultural heritage. The rights and freedoms of all ethnic groups, including the freedom of religious belief and the freedom to use and develop their ethnic groupsâ spoken and written languages, are fully protected. Facts have long disproved the so-called âgenocideâ and âforced laborâ as egregious lies. The human rights conditions there are at their historical best, as recognized by the international community. While pointing fingers at developing countriesâ human rights conditions over the years, the EU is in fact experiencing worrying human rights conditions in itself. Recent years have seen in European countries infringement of the rights of refugees and migrants, rising exclusivism and racism, negligence over economic, social and cultural rights and the right to development, and selective application and double standards on issues such as freedom of press and forced labor. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights pointed out that some EU countries are backsliding on fundamental human rights commitments.â China strongly urges the EU to recognize Chinaâs progress in the human rights cause, put down arrogance and bias, abandon the hypocritical double standards, take concrete action to improve its own human rights conditions, stop using human rights as a pretext to interfere in Chinaâs internal affairs and judicial sovereignty, and stop politicizing, instrumentalizing and weaponizing human rights issues. China Daily: On December 8, the US Department of State issued a human rights report related to Xinjiang, saying that the Chinese authorities have committed genocide and crimes against humanity against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang and announcing sanctions on two Chinese officials. On the same day, the US Department of the Treasury added them to the Specially Designated Nationals List. The US Department of Homeland Security has also added three Chinese companies to the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) Entity list under domestic law. Do you have any comment on this? Mao Ning: The US has made up and spread the false narrative on Xinjiang and imposed illegal sanctions on Chinese companies and officials citing the so-called human rights issues in Xinjiang. This has seriously undermined the interests of relevant Chinese companies and individuals, seriously interfered in Chinaâs internal affairs and seriously breached the basic norms governing international relations. We are firmly against and strongly condemn that. What Xinjiang has achieved in its development is there for all to see and Chinaâs Xinjiang policy is widely supported by the people. The US has no right and is in no position to point fingers at the human rights situation in Xinjiang. The so-called âgenocideâ and âforced laborâ are nothing but the biggest lie of the century spread by the US with the aim to contain and suppress China and has long been exposed in front of facts and truths. The US, under its own domestic law, has included Chinese entities and personnel into its sanction list in an attempt to disrupt Xinjiangâs prosperity and stability and hold back Chinaâs development, which fully lays bare its malicious intention of using issues related to Xinjiang to contain China.ââ The US is fraught with domestic human rights issues and it has a quite notorious international human rights record. If the US truly cared about human rights, it needs to earnestly address its domestic problems such as racial discrimination, gun violence and drug abuse. The last thing it should do is to veto the Security Council resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire, the only country that has done so, while the humanitarian disaster in Gaza deteriorates by the hour. We urge the US to stop smearing China, cancel the illegal unilateral sanctions on Chinese personnel and companies, and stop implementing wrongful acts such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. China will take resolute counter measures to protect the legitimate and lawful rights and interests of Chinese citizens and companies. AFP: The foreign ministry of the Philippines summoned the Chinese Ambassador over the recent collision in the South China Sea to lodge a protest with China. Whatâs your response? Mao Ning: The responsibility of the incident completely lies with the Philippines. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China has lodged dÃ©marches in strong protest to the Philippine side. Antara: On Gaza, whatâs the next step that China will take after the US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza? Mao Ning: As the humanitarian crisis in Gaza drags on, the top priority is to realize a ceasefire. Though the Security Council resolution draft has been vetoed, the international community should not stop promoting ceasefire, protecting civilians, and easing the humanitarian crisis and the UN Security Council should not stop upholding justice and shouldering its responsibilities. China stands ready to work with the international community to pool all efforts on the common goal of ceasing hostilities in Gaza and work relentlessly to realize the goal.  Reuters: Viet Nam media has reported citing the Chinese ambassador to Viet Nam that China is ready to offer grants to Viet Nam to upgrade a railway link from Guangxi to Hanoi and also to speed up plans to develop other railway systems connecting both China and Viet Nam. Are there more details on this development? And whether this topic is going to be a top discussion when President Xi Jinping visits Viet Nam this week? Mao Ning: China and Viet Nam enjoy a long-standing friendship and deepening practical cooperation. China is Viet Namâs largest trading partner, and Viet Nam is Chinaâs largest trading partner in ASEAN and the fourth largest trading partner in the world. In the field of connectivity, China and Viet Nam have carried out a lot of practical cooperation, such as the Hanoi light rail Line 2 constructed by Chinese enterprises, which is the first urban light rail project in Viet Nam and has made travel more convenient for Hanoi citizens. Cooperation between China and Viet Nam has brought tangible benefits to the two peoples. Both countries are willing to further expand bilateral cooperation. During General Secretary and President Xiâs upcoming visit to Viet Nam this time, the leaders will exchange views on deepening bilateral cooperation. Please stay tuned and check back for more information on this visit later. AFP: Also on the Philippines, the US has called for Beijing to halt what it called its âdangerous and destabilizingâ actions in the South China Sea. Whatâs Chinaâs response? Mao Ning: Iâd like to stress that maritime disputes between China and the Philippines are issues between China and the Philippines. Any third party is not in the position of interfering in the issues. On the one hand, the US, out of selfish geopolitical calculations, has for some time been conniving at, emboldening and supporting the Philippinesâ infringement and provocation in the South China Sea. Yet on the other, the US has been fanning disputes, misrepresenting facts, stoking confrontation and undermining regional peace and stability. China will continue to take necessary steps in accordance with domestic and international laws to firmly safeguard its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests. Macau Monthly: In a recent interview, Viet Namâs ambassador to China Pham Sao Mai said that General Secretary and President Xi Jinping will elevate Chinaâs comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership with Viet Nam to a new level. Do you have any comment?â Mao Ning: China and Viet Nam are both socialist countries on a path of reform and transformation in keeping with our respective national realities. Strengthening solidarity and friendship and deepening mutually-beneficial cooperation serves the shared interests of both sides and contributes to peace, stability and prosperity of the region and beyond. China and Viet Nam both attach high importance to the upcoming state visit by General Secretary and President Xi Jinping. A shared path and a shared future is the hallmark of China-Viet Nam relations. An elevated bilateral relationship is a natural result in accordance with the overwhelming trend. Standing at a new historical point, the two sides will be guided by the high-level common understandings, carry forward our traditional friendship, hold dear our shared cause and mission, and make new progress in growing our comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. AFP: I got a question on the Belt and Road Initiative and the country of Papua New Guinea. Its Prime Minister James Marape has promised to tread carefully with Belt and Road funding from China. He told AFP on Monday that he will not be ârecklessâ with foreign loans. Do you have any reaction to these comments? Mao Ning: Papua New Guinea is the first Pacific Island country to sign an MOU on Belt and Road cooperation and Belt and Road cooperation plans with China. It has played a leading role and set an example in the Belt and Road cooperation between China and Pacific Island countries. China stands ready to continue working with Papua New Guinea to synergize the development strategies, expand practical cooperation in various fields under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative on the basis of mutual respect and equal-footed consultation, and pursue common development.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on December 8, 2023"," After China started managing COVID-19 with measures against Class-B infectious diseases from January 8, 2023, the Chinese government has improved visa and entry policies for foreign nationals to facilitate cross-border travel. As a provisional measure, Chinese embassies and consulates will charge 75 percent of the previous visa fees from December 11, 2023 to December 31, 2024. For more details, please consult Chinese embassies and consulates in relevant countries. China Review News: According to reports, Sandiaga Uno, Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy of Indonesia, said on December 7 that Indonesia is considering adopting a visa-free policy for tourists from 20 countries including China, the US and Australia to boost tourism and the economy. Malaysia earlier announced a 30-day visa-free policy for Chinese citizens. Thailand has decided to temporarily waive tourist visa requirements for visitors from China. Yesterday China and Singapore announced a 30-day mutual visa exemption arrangement. China is reaching mutual visa exemption arrangements with more neighboring countries. Do you have any comment? Wang Wenbin: China welcomes measures aimed at facilitating cross-border travel. We stand ready to work with relevant countries to create favorable conditions and provide greater convenience for easy cross-border travel. Reuters: Taiwanâs defense ministry said today that a Chinese weather balloon had crossed the Taiwan Strait median line on Thursday. Does the foreign ministry have anything to offer regarding the balloonâs location or purpose? And Taiwanâs foreign ministry today also said that China has failed to live up to the promises it made Latin American countries that ended ties with Taiwan in favor of China. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on that as well? Wang Wenbin: First of all, I would like to correct you that Taiwan is part of China. There is no so-called âdefense ministryâ or âforeign ministryâ of Taiwan. On your first question, I am not aware of the situation and this is not a question on foreign affairs. On your second question, let me say that the normal, friendly relations between China and Latin American countries are deepening and our mutually beneficial cooperation is making positive progress. No matter what the DPP authorities say or do, they cannot change such a sound momentum of growth.  China Daily: The eighth Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Foreign Ministersâ Meeting was held in Beijing yesterday. Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Myanmarâs Deputy Prime Minister and Union Minister for Foreign Affairs U Than Swe co-chaired the meeting. Can you brief us on the outcomes of the meeting? Wang Wenbin: The eighth Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) Foreign Ministersâ Meeting was successfully held in Beijing yesterday. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Myanmarâs Deputy Prime Minister and Union Minister for Foreign Affairs U Than Swe co-chaired the meeting. Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sok Chenda Sophea, Thailandâs Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara, Vietnamese Minister of Foreign Affairs Bui Thanh Son and Laosâ Chairman of the Committee for External Relations of the Party Central Committee Thongsavanh Phomvihane attended the meeting. Under the theme of âJointly Strive for Modernization and Cultivate New Strength in Subregional Developmentâ, the meeting took stock of the progress of LMC, planned for the priority work in the next stage, and made preparation and built up consensus for the fourth Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Leadersâ Meeting. Foreign Minister Wang Yi noted, since the seventh LMC Foreign Ministersâ Meeting, relevant parties have acted in the Lancang-Mekong spirit of development first, equal consultation, practicality and high efficiency, and openness and inclusiveness, taken steady steps to advance cooperation in various areas, achieved a number of new outcomes and created multiple new highlights. First, cooperation has been upgraded under high-level guidance. Second, economic and trade exchanges have been fully accelerated. Third, peopleâs wellbeing has continued to improve. Fourth, the bond of the people in Lancang-Mekong countries has been closer. As the first new sub-regional cooperation mechanism jointly initiated and launched by the six Lancang-Mekong countries, LMC has become a new, important platform for advancing mutually beneficial cooperation in the region. China suggested six priority areas for advancing LMC. First, build a closer community with a shared future. Lancang-Mekong countries need to enhance high-level exchanges to provide strategic guidance for LMC; we need to synergize development strategies to develop the big Lancang-Mekong market; and we need to put the people at the center of our work and bring the benefit of cooperation to our people. Second, build a more inter-connected economic development belt. The six countries need to fully improve infrastructure connectivity, expand trade and investment and improve the network of industrial and supply chains; and we also need to carry out closer cooperation on cross-border special economic zones to boost common development. Third, foster a more secure development environment. The six countries need to take security cooperation as a key cooperation area for the next stage, adopt the Operation of âThe Safety of the Lancang-Mekong Regionâ at an early date, combat sub-regional cross-border crimes, especially telecom fraud and online gambling, and eradicate the security problems jeopardizing peopleâs security and disrupting development. Fourth, move towards a more digital development prospect. Sci-tech authorities of the six countries are discussing the establishment of a sub-regional innovation corridor, and China is ready to carry out more cooperation on digital economy and innovation under the framework of such corridor. In accordance with the spirit of the Global AI Governance Initiative, China and the five Mekong countries will actively explore cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence. Fifth, deepen people-to-people and cultural cooperation with more distinctive features. The six countries will carry out diverse forms of people-to-people and cultural exchanges in tourism, sports, media, sub-national cooperation, universities, youth and other fields, so as to enhance the friendship and affinity of the six peoples. Sixth, champion more inclusive cooperation. We will not engage in exclusive cliques and are committed to the right direction of regional economic integration. We will vigorously promote the coordinated development of the LMC with the Greater Mekong Sub-Region economic cooperation, the Three River Basin Mechanism and the Mekong River Commission, and make the sub-region a harmonious home of openness, inclusiveness, exchanges and mutual learning. The foreign ministers of the Mekong countries spoke highly of the positive progress made in LMC and appreciated Chinaâs positive contribution to promoting LMC. They agreed that LMC has become an important platform for maintaining regional peace and stability, promoting regional development and prosperity, and boosting industrialization and modernization of various countries. In the current complex and challenging international security and economic situation, Lancang-Mekong countries should jointly advance sub-regional cooperation, deepen interdependence, make good use of institutional platforms and relevant funds, coordinate efforts for development and security, and respond to traditional and non-traditional security challenges in a coordinated manner. Some countries have also identified specific areas for strengthening industrialization cooperation, which is constructive and forward-looking. All parties agreed to build a stronger Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Economic Development Belt, deepen cooperation in priority areas such as connectivity, further unleash development potential, jointly address global challenges, and build an even closer Lancang-Mekong community with a shared future. This foreign ministersâ meeting is efficient, pragmatic and productive, which has further strengthened the determination and confidence of the six countries to jointly build a community of shared future of peace and prosperity among Mekong-Lancang countries. China will work with Mekong countries to jointly build an exemplar for Belt and Road cooperation, a pacesetter for implementing the Global Development Initiative, a pioneer for implementing the Global Security Initiative and a front runner for implementing the Global Civilization Initiative. We will build a more solid foundation for the LMC, enable it to move forward more steadily and make the pace more steady with broader prospect and bring more benefits to the people of countries in the region. Bloomberg: Bloomberg today published a story with reporting that suggests that Chinese authorities in recent years have placed curbs on the ability of ethnic Mongolians in Inner Mongolia to express their ethnic identity such as the ability to study in schools using the Mongolian language. Given that Chinaâs policies pertaining to ethnic minorities have been a point of contention in the past between it and the US, the EU and others, does the foreign ministry expect such findings to have an impact on future diplomatic relations? Wang Wenbin: Iâm not aware of the report. Can you explain the main opinions of it? Bloomberg: The main opinions are that in a recent reporting trip to Inner Mongolia they found that in schools there students are no longer allowed to learn using ethnic Mongolian language and must learn using Chinese language. Wang Wenbin: The relevant reporting team you mentioned once went to Inner Mongolia for interviews. If they were really objective, serious and careful enough to walk around the streets in Inner Mongolia, they would find that the so-called restrictions on the local language environment and the teaching of Mongolian are completely unfounded.â The Chinese government upholds equality among all ethnic groups, and protects the freedom of all ethnic groups, including the Mongolians, to learn, use and develop their own spoken and written languages in accordance with the law. You asked whether Chinaâs relevant regulations will affect its relations with other countries. As long as other countries continue to develop relations with China in accordance with the principle of mutual respect and non-interference in other countriesâ internal affairs, their relations with China will not be affected.  CCTV: According to reports, the House of Representatives of the Philippines adopted a resolution on December 6 condemning Chinaâs âillegal actionsâ in the South China Sea. Do you have any comment? Wang Wenbin: The resolution adopted by the House of Representatives of the Philippines groundlessly criticized, misrepresented and smeared China. We firmly reject it. I would like to reiterate Chinaâs solemn position as follows: First, China has indisputable sovereignty over Nanhai Zhudao, consisting of Dongsha Qundao, Xisha Qundao, Zhongsha Qundao and Nansha Qundao, and their adjacent waters, and has sovereign rights and jurisdiction over relevant waters. Chinaâs sovereignty, rights and interests in the South China Sea were established in the long course of history, and are solidly grounded in history and the law. Second, the Arbitral Tribunal in the South China Sea Arbitration violated the principle of state consent, exercised its jurisdiction ultra vires and rendered an award in disregard of the law. This is a grave violation of UNCLOS and general international law. The award is illegal, null and void. China does not accept or recognize it, and will never accept any claim or action based on the award. This is firmly grounded in international law. Chinaâs sovereignty and rights and interests in the South China Sea shall under no circumstances be affected by the illegal award. Any attempt to impose the illegal award on China is in violation of international law. Third, Chinaâs construction and deployment of necessary defense facilities on its own territory in Nansha Qundao, and the patrols by Chinese military and Coast Guard ships, the scientific research activities by relevant Chinese departments, and the fishing activities by Chinese fishing boats in waters under Chinaâs jurisdiction are all legitimate, lawful and beyond reproach. Fourth, Renâai Jiao is part of Chinaâs Nansha Qundao. The Philippines illegally grounded a warship there and frequently sent vessels to illegally intrude into the reefâs adjacent waters to deliver construction materials in an attempt to reinforce the grounded warship. This amounts to grave infringement on Chinaâs sovereignty. China will continue to do what is necessary to firmly safeguard its sovereignty in accordance with domestic and international law. Fifth, Chinaâs summer fishing moratorium in the South China Sea is a normal measure aimed at protecting marine biological resources in waters under its jurisdiction and a concrete step in fulfilling its obligations under international law including UNCLOS. The Philippine side should not make wanton remarks about this.ââ Sixth, for some time, the Philippines has been sending people to Tiexian Jiao and other uninhabited islands and reefs of Chinaâs Nansha Islands and sending aircraft and vessels to intrude into adjacent waters and airspace of Chinaâs Nansha Islands and Huangyan Dao. These moves severely violate Chinaâs sovereignty, endanger Chinaâs security, go against the spirit of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) and undermine peace and stability in the South China Sea. China has made serious dÃ©marches for nearly 100 times and officially expressed our protest to the Philippines. We once again urge the Philippines to stop hyping up maritime disputes between China and the Philippines, stop its infringement of Chinaâs sovereignty and provocation at sea, return to the right track of resolving maritime disputes through negotiation and consultation as soon as possible and work with China to safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea. Kyodo News: During a meeting with Chief Representative Yamaguchi Natsuo of Japanâs Komeito party on December 6, Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Jianghao said that efforts will be made to promote exchanges and communication between parties and political figures and other areas. The communication between the ruling parties in China and Japan, however, has not been officially resumed. Whatâs Chinaâs attitude towards this? Wang Wenbin: China is open to exchanges and cooperation with Japan, including inter-party exchanges. We hope that Japan will work with China to follow the important mutual understandings reached by the leaders of the two countries, act on the principles and consensus in the four political documents between China and Japan, and align efforts to improve bilateral ties with the commitment to promoting a strategic relationship of mutual benefit, and work hard towards the goal of building a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship fit for the new era. Beijing Daily: According to reports, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, based on Article 99 of the UN Charter, wrote to the rotating president of the Security Council saying that the situation in Gaza may threaten world peace and security and calling on the Security Council to take steps to realize humanitarian ceasefire and averting an even worse humanitarian disaster. Itâs the first time in over five decades for the UN Secretary-General to invoke Article 99. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Wang Wenbin: As this round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict drags on and causes severe humanitarian disaster, the call of the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reflects the strong concern of the international community on the serious situation in Gaza. The world must take more active steps to save lives and restore peace. The Security Council should listen to the call of the vast Arab and Islamic countries and the international community, take further and timely actions, realize a comprehensive ceasefire, protect civilians and ease the humanitarian situation. The recently released Position Paper of the Peopleâs Republic of China on Resolving the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict fully reflects the above-mentioned position. China supports the mediation work of the UN Secretary-General and the UN Secretariat, we will continue to enhance coordination with relevant sides and play a constructive role in deescalating the situation.  Reuters: Could you tell us has Zambiaâs official creditor committee co-chaired by China reached an agreement on how they define comparability of treatment and what they want from Zambiaâs bondholders to achieve that? And have any further meetings been held on Zambiaâs debt, either just the official creditor committee or the committee with Zambia and all the bondholders? Wang Wenbin: China takes Zambiaâs debt issue seriously and has always been actively advancing the settlement of debts by the Creditor Committee for Zambia. China always calls on parties to participate in Zambiaâs debt treatment in accordance with the principle of joint actions and fair burden-sharing, and the aim is to comprehensively, systematically and effectively help Zambia emerge from the debt crisis. The Creditor Committee for Zambia is in consultations on this and relevant Chinese authorities will continue to participate in relevant process with a professional and responsible attitude. Bloomberg: The US and Mexico signed an agreement on screening foreign investments specifically in relation to Chinese companies. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on the development? Wang Wenbin: China believes that restricting normal trade and investment activities and disrupting relevant cooperation for political purposes does not serve the interests of any party. We hope the US will not overstretch the concept of national security, respect market rules and the principle of fair competition, and provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for the investment and operation of companies from all countries in the US. China News Service: The 24th China-EU Summit was held in Beijing yesterday. Can you share the major agendas as well as the outcomes and common understandings reached at the summit? EU leaders have spoken positively of the summit, but at the same time expressed their high concern over trade imbalance and excess production capacity. What is Chinaâs response? Wang Wenbin: This yearâs China-EU Summit coincides with the 20th anniversary of the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership and the 25th anniversary of the China-EU Summit mechanism. President Xi Jinping met with the two EU Presidents and Premier Li Qiang held the summit with them. The two sides exchanged views on strategic issues bearing on the China-EU relations, dialogue and cooperation in various fields, major concerns of the two sides, global governance and major international and regional issues. Both sides believe that the talks are candid, deep-going and productive, and that the two sides have enhanced mutual understanding, deepened strategic communication, and built up consensus for cooperation. First, the summit charted the course for the growth of China-EU relations. The two sides agreed to fully leverage the guiding role of the China-EU Summit and the five high-level dialogues, step up dialogue and cooperation, properly manage differences, and make China-EU relations more stable and mutually beneficial. Second, the summit identified key areas for closer mutually beneficial cooperation. Dialogue and cooperation will be stepped up in such areas as trade and investment, green development, digital economy, artificial intelligence, geographical indication, intellectual property rights and export control. Third, the summit demonstrated the two sidesâ willingness to resume cross-border travel and enhance people-to-people exchange. The two sides agreed to hold another meeting of the China-EU high-level people-to-people dialogue. Fourth, the summit sent out a strong message of China-EU joint response to global challenges. The two sides agreed to support and practice multilateralism, step up international coordination, advance reforms of the WTO and the international financial system, and jointly respond to global challenges such as climate change, bio diversity, food security and public health. On the issue of trade imbalance, we must see that the current situation in China-EU trade is the result from the combined influence of macro-economic environment, international trade conditions and the two sidesâ industrial structures. One should not simply put the responsibility on one side only, or blame market access. As for the EUâs repeated claim that its trade deficit against China surged last year, it was largely affected by energy price and geopolitical factors and was quite a special phenomenon. This year, the trade deficit has greatly decreased. China has never deliberately pursued trade surplus. Chinaâs mega market will remain open to the EU and we welcome EU companies to share in the opportunities arising from Chinaâs high-quality development and high-level opening up. At the same time, we hope that the EU will ease the export restrictions on high-tech products. This will effectively improve trade balance. âExcess production capacityâ is a relative term. One cannot just see the demand of a specific country or region, but needs to view it from the perspective of economic globalization. Chinaâs new energy industry enjoys international competitiveness and can play an important role in the EUâs green transition and the global response to climate change. We hope the EU will see this issue from an objective and just manner. China is not to blame for the inadequate impetus for the EUâs industrial growth, and the EU should not take this as a pretext to adopt trade protectionist measures. China stands ready to work with the EU to deliver on the important common understandings reached at the summit, remain committed to our partnership, to mutually-beneficial cooperation and to dialogue and consultation, properly manage differences and promote the sound, steady and sustained growth of China-EU relations. Bloomberg: I just had a clarification question from your earlier announcement on the visa fees. Is that for all countries or only specific countries? Wang Wenbin: It applies to all Chinese embassies and consulates overseas. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on December 7, 2023"," At the invitation of the government of Argentina, President Xi Jinpingâs Special Envoy and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Peopleâs Congress Wu Weihua will attend the inauguration of the incoming President of Argentina Javier Milei in Buenos Aires on December 10. ANSA: Italy has formally informed Beijing of its decision to end its participation in the Belt and Road Initiative it joined in 2019. Is it possible to get any comment on this topic? What does it mean from the Chinese point of view? What does it mean for the Sino-Italian relations? Wang Wenbin: The Belt and Road Initiative, proposed a decade ago, has delivered benefits to over 150 countries, becoming a most popular international public good and largest platform for international cooperation. In October this year, the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation was held in Beijing. A total of 151 countries, including Italy, and 41 international organizations sent representatives to the event, which produced 458 deliverables. The success of the forum sends out a clear message of seeking solidarity, collaboration, openness and win-win results and demonstrates the enormous appeal and global influence of Belt and Road cooperation. China firmly opposes attempts to smear and sabotage Belt and Road cooperation or stoke bloc confrontation and division. Xinhua News Agency: At the recent 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), more than 100 countries agreed to triple the installed capacity of renewable energy before 2030. Foreign media commented that China is the only major country at COP28 that is expected to achieve that goal. Whatâs your comment?â Wang Wenbin: China attaches great importance to the development of renewable energy, and turned from âfollowersâ to âforerunnersâ and even âpacesettersâ in a short timespan. New heights are constantly achieved in installed capacity, power generation, and industrial competitiveness. We are making solid strides in deepening the energy revolution, contributing to the global response to climate change. Chinaâs investment in renewable energy has topped the world for seven years in a row. The installed capacity of renewable energy also topped the world, exceeding 1.4 terawatt, higher than the coal-fired energy. More than half of the NEVs are in China. Green and low-carbon development has become part of the life of the Chinese people. At the Hangzhou Asian Games successfully held not long ago, the conventional power of all the stadiums was generated with green energy. More than 100 million people contributed their âgreen energyâ with low-carbon activities, making the Hangzhou Asian Games the first ever carbon-neutral Asian Games. We are actively promoting green energy internationally, assisting more developing countries in writing green chapters in their development. From the Karot Hydropower Project in Pakistan to the De Aar Wind Power Project in South Africa, and to the Al Dhafra PV2 Solar Power Plant in the UAE, China-contracted renewable projects are all over the world, lighting up the dreams of green and low-carbon development of more countries. Currently, 50 percent of the worldâs wind power equipment and 80 percent of the PV equipment are from China. By September this year, China had signed 48 South-South MOUs on climate change with dozens of developing countries, built four demonstration zones on low-carbon development, carried out 75 projects on the mitigation and adaptation of climate change, and brought the benefit of green and low-carbon development to more countries. China will continue to promote green and sustainable development, contributing to the global response to climate change to the best of our capabilities. We also hope that members of the COP28 could fully implement the consensus, making corresponding contributions to achieve relevant targets according to their national conditions, and jointly addressing the challenges and bottlenecks facing the development of the renewable energy, making relentless efforts in implementing the Paris Agreement fully and effectively to build a clean and beautiful world. Beijing Daily: Japanâs National Institute for Defense Studies issued the China Security Report 2024 recently, which says that as China builds up its military strength, including nuclear power, and deepens strategic coordination with Russia, the US will have to face more intense rivalry from China and Russia in the future. The report also says that Japan must further strengthen the necessary defense capabilities to deter Chinaâs attempts to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait through reliance on force. What is Chinaâs comment? Wang Wenbin: China is committed to peaceful development and adheres to a national defense policy that is defensive in nature. Chinaâs growth means a stronger force for world peace. Taiwan is part of China and the Taiwan question is Chinaâs internal affair. How to resolve the Taiwan question is a matter for the Chinese and brooks no external interference. The report of the Japanese think tank pointed fingers at Chinaâs internal affairs, modernization of Chinaâs military and Chinaâs relations with other countries. The comments are irresponsible and donât hold water. For historical reasons, Japanâs military and security moves have been closely watched by its Asian neighbors and the international community. In recent years, Japan has greatly increased its military expenditure and sought to develop offensive weapons, which has caused grave concern from its neighbors and the international community. We urge Japan to earnestly respect the security concerns of its neighbors, profoundly reflect on its history of aggression, stop hyping up the âChina threatâ narrative and using it as a pretext for its own military buildup, and take substantive steps to earn the trust of its Asian neighbors and the international community.  The New York Times: Have the talks so far with EU leaders produced any substantive progress on relations? Wang Wenbin: This morning, President Xi Jinping met with President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen who are in China for the 24th China-EU Summit. Iâd like to take this opportunity to share some information on that with you. President Xi noted that since the end of last year, the China-EU relations have shown a sound momentum of consolidation and growth, and the high-level dialogues between the two sides in strategic, economic and trade, green and digital fields have produced rich results, which meets the interests of both sides and the expectations of our people. China and the EU are two major forces advancing multipolarity, two major markets in support of globalization, and two major civilizations championing diversity. In the current international landscape of increasing turbulence, the China-EU relations are of strategic significance and global influence, bearing on world peace, stability and prosperity. The two sides have the responsibility to jointly provide the world with more stability and impetus for development. President Xi stressed that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership. Both sides need to take stock of past experience, navigate the trend of the world, and uphold the comprehensive strategic partnership. The two sides need to consolidate the political foundation, view each other from a strategic perspective, give full play to the leading role of the leadersâ meeting and the five high-level dialogues, strengthen strategic communication, and enhance understanding and properly handle differences through constructive dialogue. The two sides need to form a correct perception, enhance mutual understanding and trust, honor commitments with good faith, and focus on growing our relations. We should not regard each other as rivals just because we have different systems, reduce cooperation just because there is competition, or engage in confrontation just because we have differences. The economies of China and Europe are highly complementary, and the two sides need to do more to cement the bond of shared interests between China and Europe through deeper and broader cooperation. Chinaâs economic growth has maintained a momentum of steady and sound growth. China is pursuing high-quality development and high-level opening-up, and is willing to regard the EU as a key partner in economic and trade cooperation, a priority partner in scientific and technological cooperation, and a reliable partner in industrial and supply chain cooperation, in pursuit of mutual benefit and common development. The two sides need to enhance complementarity in market, capital and technology, promote the upgrading of traditional industries and the development of emerging industries, explore new models of cooperation, create new growth areas, and work together to improve industrial and supply chains. The two sides also need to strengthen people-to-people exchanges and facilitate cross-border travels. President Xi Jinping stressed that the Chinese modernization and the integration of the EU are strategic decisions made by China and the EU with an eye to the future. China and the EU should respect and support each other, strengthen the synergy of development strategies and achieve common development. The Belt and Road Initiative is an open platform that has brought tangible benefits to more than 150 countries and people around the world. China is ready to continue to promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, including synergizing with the EUâs Global Gateway initiative, to help developing countries accelerate their development. The two sides should strengthen communication and coordination under the frameworks of the United Nations, the Group of 20 and others, adhere to multilateralism, oppose bloc confrontation, promote political solutions to international and regional hotspot issues, and carry out dialogues and cooperation on major issues concerning the future of mankind, such as artificial intelligence, so as to contribute to the well-being of mankind and addressing global challenges. President Charles Michel and President Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU and China are the worldâs two major forces, and are important economic and trade partners for each other, with the field of cooperation getting increasingly broader. EU-China cooperation is reciprocal and equal-footed. Sound management and development of the EU-China relationship is directly related to the interests of the two peoples, and the worldâs prosperity and security. The EU attaches great importance to its relationship with China, does not want to decouple from China, and looks forward to building long-term, stable, predictable and sustainable development with China. It is hoped that this meeting will give new impetus to the future development of EU-China relations. The EU is pleased to see the results of the high-level dialogues in various fields since this year, and believes that the long-term and stable development of Chinaâs economy is in the interests of the EU. It hopes that the two sides will continue to strengthen dialogues and cooperation in economy and trade, green and digital development, and so on, and make joint efforts to safeguard the stability and security of the supply chain and industrial chain, strengthen dialogues and seek cooperation on such major global issues as climate change and artificial intelligence, which concerns the future of mankind. The EU is committed to the one-China policy. It stands ready to step up communication with China on differences in the spirit of mutual respect, openness and candidness to enhance mutual understanding. The two sides shoulder shared responsibilities for and have common interests in peace and stability in the world. The EU is ready to have close communication and collaboration with China to uphold multilateralism and the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and to facilitate the resolution of regional hotspot issues including in Ukraine and the Middle East. As we can see from the readout, it was a useful meeting where both sides sent out a positive message of China and the EU working together for further progress in our relations. Later on, Premier Li Qiang will jointly chair the 24th China-EU Summit with the two EU leaders. We will release information on that in a timely manner as well. Please stay tuned. AFP: A US State Department official said yesterday that Washington was monitoring reports of Chinese warships docking at a Cambodian port. Could you confirm this? Which are the warships that have docked at the Cambodian port? Is this the first time that Chinese warships have docked in Cambodia? Is there a plan for them to participate in military exercises? Wang Wenbin: China and Cambodia enjoy a profound friendship. Our two countries have had fruitful cooperation in various sectors. As to the visit by Chinese navy ships to Cambodia, Iâd refer you to the competent authorities.â  CCTV: China just announced that General Secretary and President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to Viet Nam. How does China view the current China-Viet Nam relations? Can you share whatâs on the agenda of the visit and Chinaâs expectation? Wang Wenbin: China and Viet Nam are both socialist countries and neighbors. After the 20th CPC National Congress at the end of last year, General Secretary and President Xi Jinping invited General Secretary of the Communist Party of Viet Nam Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong for a visit to China. The two leaders jointly charted the course for the China-Viet Nam comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. This year has seen frequent high-level interactions, close exchanges between various departments and regions, and deeper cooperation in various fields, which have brought tangible benefits to the peoples of the two countries. The world is in a new period of disorder and transformation, with increasing instabilities and uncertainties. China and Viet Nam are both socialist countries and both are advancing reform and transformation that fits their respective national realities. Greater solidarity, closer friendship and deeper mutually-beneficial cooperation is in the common interests of both sides and conducive to peace, stability and prosperity of the region and the wider world. During the visit, General Secretary Xi Jinping will hold talks respectively with General Secretary of the Communist Party of Viet Nam Central Committee Nguyen Phu Trong and State President Vo Van Thuong and meet with Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh of Viet Nam and Chairman of the National Assembly Vuong Dinh Hue. The two sides will discuss upgrading the China-Viet Nam relations, focus on six major areas including politics, security, practical cooperation, public support, multilateral affairs and maritime issues, and work to deepen and substantiate the comprehensive strategic cooperation between the two countries. This will help both countries to jointly follow their modernization paths with respective features, enrich the paths to modernization for developing countries and bring more benefits to the two peoples.â The New York Times: Europe has been expressing more concern this year about security issues in connection with China. Is Europe following Americaâs views on security and Ukraine instead of assessing Europeâs own interests? What is Chinaâs view? Wang Wenbin: China always views its relations with Europe from a strategic height and long-term perspective and sees Europe as a comprehensive strategic partner and an important force in a multi-polar world. We support the EU in upholding strategic autonomy, working together with China to practice true multilateralism and jointly striving to safeguard world peace, promote common development and tackle global challenges. Bloomberg: Singapore and China will establish a 30-day visa-free travel arrangement between the two countries. This is according to an official visiting from Singapore. Do you have any details on this? Can you confirm what he said?â Wang Wenbin: Stronger people-to-people exchange between China and Singapore serves the fundamental interests of both peoples. The two sides have agreed on mutual visa exemption for holders of ordinary passport. As we speak, competent departments of the two countries are having close communication over the specifics. The full mutual visa exemption between China and Singapore will be great news for our two peoples. Both sides are looking forward to the early implementation of the relevant arrangement. AFP: Australia has signed a security agreement with Papua New Guinea. Considering the deepening relationship between China and Papua New Guinea in recent years, what is Chinaâs position on this latest security deal? Wang Wenbin: China welcomes normal exchange and equal cooperation between Pacific island countries and countries in and outside the region. China maintains sound cooperative relations with Pacific island countries based on the principles of equality, mutual respect, win-win cooperation, openness and inclusiveness. Relevant cooperation runs in parallel and is complementary with other bilateral and multilateral cooperation. China stands ready to work with countries that truly care Pacific island countries to leverage respective strengths and jointly form an international synergy to support Pacific island countries in enhancing their capability for self-driven and sustainable development.â "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on December 6, 2023"," As agreed with the Mekong countries, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) co-chair Myanmarâs Deputy Prime Minister and Union Minister for Foreign Affairs U Than Swe will jointly host the eighth LMC Foreign Ministersâ Meeting in Beijing on December 7. CCTV: To follow up on your announcement that Foreign Minister Wang Yi will host the eighth Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) Foreign Ministersâ Meeting on December 7, how does China see the current development of LMC and what is Chinaâs expectation for the meeting? Wang Wenbin: LMC is the first new sub-regional cooperation mechanism jointly initiated and launched by the six Lancang-Mekong countries. Over the past seven years since its launch, the six Lancang-Mekong countries have built up consensus and worked together at the LMC platform in the spirit of mutual benefit for common development, and achieved a number of practical outcomes. Connectivity projects such as the China-Laos Railway, the China-Thailand Railway and the Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport have boosted the regionâs trade and cross-border travel, doubling the annual trade volume between China and the Mekong countries over the past seven years. The LMC Special Fund has supported hundreds of livelihood cooperation projects, including the LMC Bumper Harvest Projects, the Lancang-Mekong Sweet Spring Action, and the Green Lancang-Mekong Initiative, bringing tangible benefits to the people of these countries. Amid changes and instability in the world, China attaches great importance to the LMC Foreign Ministersâ Meeting. We hope to have an in-depth exchange of views with Mekong countries at the meeting on deeper and more substantive cooperation, jointly make the region an exemplar for high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, a pacesetter for implementing the Global Development Initiative, a pioneer for implementing the Global Security Initiative and a front runner for implementing the Global Civilization Initiative, and build a Lancang-Mekong community with a shared future that enjoys close people-to-people bond, mutual help and common prosperity. AFP: The China-EU Summit will be held in Beijing this week. Yesterday, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said that the EU will not tolerate over time an imbalance in the trade relationship between the EU and China. She added that âWe have tools to protect our market, but we prefer to have negotiated solutions.â What is Chinaâs response to this? Is China concerned over the possibility of a trade war with the EU in the future? Wang Wenbin: First of all, let me say that China has never deliberately sought trade surplus. On the contrary, we have consistently advanced high-level opening up and invited all countries to share Chinaâs mega market with a population of over 1.4 billion by hosting the China International Import Expo and the China International Supply Chain Expo. The current China-EU trade situation is a result under the combined influence of macro-economic environment, international trade conditions and the industrial structures of the two sides. Besides, in light of the deep integration of global industrial and supply chains, trade statistics does not reflect the profit distribution in China-EU trade. Over one-third of export from EU companies in China was sold to the EU. Although China appears to have the trade surplus, in fact, the EU has reaped considerable profits. Moreover, trade involves both sides. If the EU sets strict restrictions on the export of high-tech products to China on the one hand, and on the other, hopes to greatly increase export to China, this may not be a reasonable expectation. When it comes to tackling the prominent problems faced by Europe and effectively addressing global challenges, China is a reliable andâ indispensable partner for the EU. Properly settling differences through dialogue and consultation is an important lesson weâve learned from how the China-EU relations have grown. We hope the EU will work with China together to create sound atmosphere for the upcoming China-EU summit and make joint efforts for the sound and steady growth of China-EU relations.  Jiji Press: According to reports, China has recently tightened export control over urea and ammonium phosphate. The export of urea is suspended and the export inspection application for ammonium phosphate was also asked to stop. What are the reasons behind this? Can the Foreign Ministry share some comment? Wang Wenbin: China is a major producer and consumer of fertilizer. According to what we have learned from competent authorities, in the first ten months of this year, China has exported 25.72 million tonnes of fertilizer in total, up by 28.8 percent year-on-year, making itself a major participant in international fertilizer trade. As for your specific question, Iâd refer you to competent authorities. Beijing Youth Daily: It was reported that the International Symposium Commemorating the 75th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was held in Beijing recently. Can you share more information? Wang Wenbin: On December 5, the China Foundation for Human Rights Development held the International Symposium Commemorating the 75th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in Beijing. Senior officials from Asian, African, Latin American and European countries and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights as well as diplomats in China, experts and scholars, and representatives from civil society organizations attended the symposium. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended the opening ceremony and delivered a keynote speech, in which he elaborated on the important views of President Xi Jinping on human rights, Chinaâs human rights development path, and Chinaâs position and propositions on global human rights governance. Relevant parties had in-depth discussions at the symposium on the promotion of economic, social and cultural rights, human rights development paths and global human rights governance, and shared their insights on ways of reforming and improving global human rights governance under the new situation. The Beijing Declaration issued at the symposium reflects international consensus and provides useful ideas on advancing the worldâs human rights cause. China stands ready to take this symposium as an opportunity to work with all parties to uphold the common values of mankind, step up human rights dialogue and cooperation, deepen exchanges and mutual learning, take an active part in global human rights governance, protect and promote human rights through security, development and cooperation, advance the worldâs human rights cause, and jointly build a community with a shared future for mankind. Reuters: Moodyâs on Tuesday put a downgrade warning on Chinaâs credit rating and said it expected Chinaâs economic growth to slow over the coming decade. Is there anything the foreign ministry has to offer to put foreign investors at ease, so that they will not be concerned about investing in China? Wang Wenbin: The Ministry of Finance of China has made response to that, which you may refer to. Iâd like to stress that since the beginning of this year, Chinaâs macroeconomy has seen a sustained rebound and steady progress in high-quality development. New growth drivers of Chinaâs economy are delivering results. China is capable of deepening reform and addressing risks and challenges. Multiple international institutions recently revised up their forecasts of Chinaâs economic growth for this year, expressing optimism about the strong internal driving force, resilience and potential of Chinaâs economy. The IMF and OECD revised up Chinaâs growth forecasts of 2023 to 5.4 percent and 5.2 percent respectively. The fundamentals sustaining Chinaâs sound economic growth in the long run stay unchanged and will not change in the future. We have the confidence and ability to realize long-term steady development. Concerns expressed by Moodyâs over Chinaâs economic prospect and fiscal sustainability are unnecessary. Just as some friends from the business community have said, China has become a synonym of the best investment destination. The ânextâChinaâ is still China. We invite businesses from across the world to invest and cultivate success in China.  NHK: According to Hong Kong media reports, Agnes Chow Ting who is studying in Canada said she would not return to Hong Kong. In response to that, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR John Lee told an interview yesterday that they will do their utmost to pursue her and fugitives will be pursued for life unless they turn themselves in. Does the Foreign Ministry have any response to that? Wang Wenbin: We support the government and judiciary of the Hong Kong SAR in performing their duties in accordance with the law.ââ Global Times: Itâs reported that the UN General Assembly (UNGA) at its 78th session adopted the resolution âNo first placement of weapons in outer spaceâ co-sponsored by China and Russia, which reaffirms the goal of preventing an arms race in outer space and calls on countries to start talks on international legal instrument based on the Draft Treaty on the Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects (PPWT) introduced by China and Russia. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Wang Wenbin: Safeguarding the security and peace of the outer space and preventing an arms race in outer space is the long-term common aspiration of the international community. The first UN special session devoted to disarmament in 1978 clearly proposed to prevent an arms race in outer space through negotiation. For over four decades since then, the UNGA has adopted relevant resolutions with overwhelming support every year that call for negotiations of new international legal instrument and reflect the concerns of the international community on moves that could turn outer space into a weapon or battlefield. China, Russia and other countries have submitted to the UNGA the draft resolution on âNo first placement of weapons in outer spaceâ for many years in a row, calling on countries to take effective measures to prevent an arms race in outer space and start negotiations on relevant international legal instrument at an early date. The fact that the resolution was adopted every year with strong support speaks to the international communityâs firm support for negotiations on an international legal instrument on arms control in outer space and for not placing weapons in outer space.â Regrettably, certain countries, unwilling to have their military buildup in outer space constrained, have long refused to acknowledge the fundamental approach of negotiating a legal instrument on technical grounds and even questioned the basic consensus of preventing an arms race in outer space. We hope relevant countries will demonstrate political will, correct their wrong practice, support and constructively participate in negotiations for a legal instrument on arms control in outer space, and uphold the international order based on international law. AFP: Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said that 95 percent of voters in a referendum last week approved of the nationâs territorial claim on a huge chunk of neighboring Guyana. China is a firm ally for Venezuela and at the same time maintains friendly relations with Guyana. So does China support President Nicolas Maduroâs claim? Is China worried that Venezuela may invade Guyana? Wang Wenbin: Venezuela and Guyana are both Chinaâs good friends. China always respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries. China always supports the two countries in properly settling the issue of demarcation of their boundary through friendly consultation. This is in the interests of the people of both countries and conducive to the stability, cooperation and development of Latin America and the Caribbean.â  Dragon TV: Recently China and Jordan signed a memorandum of understanding between the two governments on jointly promoting Belt and Road cooperation. This means all Arab countries have signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with China. How does China see China-Arab Belt and Road cooperation? Wang Wenbin: On November 29, China and Jordan signed a memorandum of understanding between the government of the Peopleâs Republic of China and the government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan on jointly promoting the construction of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. This means China has signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with all 22 Arab countries and the Arab League, achieving full coverage. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative. Over the past decade, China and Arab countries, as natural partners in Belt and Road cooperation, have achieved remarkable progress with concerted efforts. China-Arab trade volume in 2022 exceeded USD 430 billion, doubling the amount a decade ago. China imported 270 million tonnes of crude oil from Arab countries, accounting for half of Chinaâs total imports of the year. The past decade has seen a surge in two-way investment between China and Arab countries. The two sides have carried out more than 200 major projects under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative, and the outcomes of cooperation have benefited nearly two billion people on both sides. The Belt and Road Initiative has become an important international public good and a major platform for international cooperation, providing strong support for building a China-Arab community with a shared future. Going forward, China looks forward to working with Arab countries to promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation on the basis of peaceful cooperation, openness and inclusiveness, mutual learning and mutual benefit so as to build a belt of development, a bridge bringing hearts closer and a road to happiness for the people of both sides. Bloomberg: Chinaâs leader will reportedly visit Viet Nam inâtheâcomingâdays. Can you confirm this and what might be on the agenda for that trip? Wang Wenbin: I have nothing to offer. The Paper: According to reports, on December 5, an EU official said that President of the European Council Charles Michel does not have a secure phone line in Beijing to talk to EU leaders without China eavesdropping. Do you have any comment on this? Wang Wenbin: It should have been clear to EU officials that it is not China who has conducted eavesdropping and espionage on leaders of EU countries and institutions.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on December 5, 2023"," China News Service: On December 1 local time, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Assembly at its 33rd session elected the new Council in London, the UK. China was once again elected a category (a) member of the Council with strong support, its 18th reelection since 1989. Would you like to comment on this? Wang Wenbin: The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is the United Nations specialized agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships. China attaches high importance to and actively supports the organizationâs work. Chinaâs reelection with strong support as a category (a) member of the IMO Council speaks to the international communityâs recognition of its contribution to global maritime governance and promoting the sustainable development of shipping. China stands ready to work with other members to continue supporting the multilateral maritime framework with the IMO at the core and jointly pursue high-quality development in the shipping industry. China Review News: It was reported that on November 29, an Air Force CV-22 Osprey of US Forces Japan crashed off the shore of Yakushima Island, Kagoshima prefecture. Japan has asked the US to have a thorough investigation into the accident and before finding the reasons, stop flying Osprey aircraft deployed in Japan. But the US ignored this demand and continued flying the aircraft. What is Chinaâs comment? Wang Wenbin: The US military, while professing that it safeguards the regionâs peace and stability, has behaved unscrupulously under the protection of exterritoriality. While professing it protects the security of allies, the US has in fact become a source of insecurity for its allies. According to statistics from the government of Okinawa Prefecture, by the end of 2020, US Forces Japan has committed over 6,000 criminal crimes and produced over 800 air accidents in Okinawa. The Osprey aircraft involved in this accident has experienced multiple severe accidents, leaving many injured, dead or missing. The US needs to take a serious and responsible attitude, take seriously the concerns of the local people, have a thorough investigation into the accident, give a reasonable explanation to relevant parties, and restore peace and tranquility in the region. ARD German Television: On December 1, Bilal Karimi started officially his position as the ambassador of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in Beijing. My question is, is China formally recognizing the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan? Wang Wenbin: As a long-standing friendly neighbor of Afghanistan, China believes that Afghanistan should not be excluded from the international community. We hope Afghanistan will further respond to the expectations of the international community, build an open and inclusive political structure, adopt moderate and prudent domestic and foreign policies, firmly combat all forms of terrorist forces, develop friendly relations with other countries, especially with its neighbors, and integrate itself into the world community. We believe that diplomatic recognition of the Afghan government will come naturally as the concerns of various parties are effectively addressed.  CCTV: China started to extend unilateral visa-free policy to six countries, namely France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia on December 1. Do you have any update on the effects of the policy? Do you have any additional information to share? Wang Wenbin: To further facilitate cross-border travel and Chinaâs high-quality development and high-standard opening up, China started to extend unilateral visa-free policy to six countries including France and Germany on December 1. The policy has produced positive effects. According to data from the National Immigration Administration, from December 1 to 3, there was a continued increase of entries from these countries. Nearly 18,000 travelers from the six countries entered China, with the daily average up by 39 percent from November 30. Nearly 7,000 of these travelers or 39 percent of the total came on the visa-free policy. From these numbers we can see how the unilateral visa-free policy is making things easier for travelers of the six countries. Going forward, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will continue to adjust visa policies to create more favorable conditions and further facilitate cross-border travel. Reuters: According to Japanese media, a Chinese citizen was arrested by Japanese police for suspicion of leaking business secret. Do you have any comment? Can you share more information on this? Wang Wenbin: I am not aware of the specifics. China always asks our citizens overseas to abide by the laws and regulations of host countries and we hope Japan will earnestly protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese citizens in Japan. Phoenix TV: Leader of the Taiwan region Tsai Ing-wen recently said at a DPP campaign rally that âwe donât want Hong Kong-style peace, we want peace with dignityâ, the 2024 general election is not a choice between peace and war, and it is the people of Taiwan who must choose peace with dignity. What is your comment? Wang Wenbin: This is not a question on foreign affairs. Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinaâs territory. The election in the Taiwan region is purely Chinaâs internal affair. I would like to stress that âTaiwan independenceâ is as incompatible with cross-Strait peace as fire with water. âTaiwan independenceâ means war and âTaiwan independenceâ is a dead end. Whatever high-sounding rhetoric the DPP authorities try to use, it cannot cover up their malicious attempt to tie Taiwan residents to the war chariot of âTaiwan independenceâ; it cannot change the fact that âTaiwan independenceâ elements are doomed to failure; and it cannot stop the irreversible trend of reunification of China.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on December 4, 2023"," At the invitation of Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Ding Xuexiang, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance of the Republic of Singapore Lawrence Wong will visit China from December 5 to 8. Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang and Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong will co-chair the 19th meeting of the China-Singapore Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation, the 24th meeting of China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Joint Steering Council (JSC), the 15th meeting of the China-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City JSC and the seventh meeting of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) Demonstration Initiative on Strategic Connectivity JSC in Tianjin on December 7.

AFP: US Commerce Secretary recently called China âthe biggest threat weâve ever hadâ and stressed âChina is not our friend.â She also urged US business leaders to put national security above short term revenue. What is your comment on this? Wang Wenbin: President Biden once noted that the US is not seeking to halt Chinaâs economic development or scientific and technological progress. However, the remarks of the US official contradict this. It will hardly win the trust from China and the rest of the world, and reveals the deep-seated Cold-War mentality and hegemonic mindset of some in the US. China never bets against the US, and has no intention to challenge or unseat it. The US needs to have a right understanding of China, work with China to earnestly deliver on the important common understandings reached between the two Presidents in their meeting in San Francisco, stop viewing China as an enemy, correct the wrong move of carrying out major-country confrontation under the pretext of competition, and avoid saying one thing and doing another. I read some comment on Chinese media platforms, which I would like to cite here and hope the US will seriously reflect on it. Going against the rules, principles and laws of free trade market is like building a dam of sievesâno matter how hard you try, the water will run through the sieves to where it is heading. Yonhap News Agency: Chinaâs General Administration of Customs has recently halted customs clearance on exports of urea to the Republic of Korea (ROK). The ROK government considers the Chinese action as an informal export restriction. Could the foreign ministry share more information with us? Wang Wenbin: We noted relevant reports. The relevant departments of China and the ROK maintain communication on this. Iâd like to refer you to the competent authorities for any specifics.â  The Paper: The United Arab Emirates (UAE), as the host country of the 28th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), held the World Climate Action Summit (WCAS) in Dubai on December 1 and 2. President Xi Jinpingâs Special Representative, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Ding Xuexiang attended the meeting and delivered an address. Could you share some information with us on that? Wang Wenbin: From November 30 to December 2, President Xi Jinpingâs Special Representative, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Ding Xuexiang attended the World Climate Action Summit (WCAS) in Dubai and delivered an address. In his address, Vice Premier Ding first conveyed President Xiâs good wishes for the UAE in hosting the summit. He recalled that eight years ago, President Xi worked with leaders of other countries to reach the Paris Agreement with utmost political determination and wisdom, and embarked on a new journey of global cooperation to address climate change. He said that China has always kept its promise and made important contributions to global climate governance and put forward a three-point proposal on global climate governance, including practicing multilateralism, accelerating green transformation, and strengthening action implementation. He stressed that we need to adhere to the goals and principles set out in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement; actively increase the proportion of renewable energy, promote the clean, low-carbon and efficient use of traditional energy, and accelerate the formation of green and low-carbon production methods and lifestyles. He added that countries need to fully honor the existing commitments. In particular, developed countries should effectively increase financial, technological and capacity building support to developing countries.â Vice Premier Dingâs address demonstrates Chinaâs sense of responsibility as a major country in actively tackling climate change and leading in global climate governance, which will help COP28 achieve positive outcomes, boost full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and build a clean and beautiful world. During the summit, Vice Premier Ding also attended and addressed the Group of 77 (G77) and China leadersâ summit on climate change, met respectively with leaders including the UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, Cuban President Miguel DÃ­az-Canel, President of the Maldives Mohamed Muizzu and UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres. He shared with them what China has achieved in enhancing ecological conservation and Chinaâs propositions on global climate and environmental governance, which has been widely recognized.â NHK: Hong Kong âpro-democracyâ activist Agnes Chow Ting, who is studying in Canada, said on social media on December 3 that sheâs living in exile in Canada and wonât return to Hong Kong for the rest of her life. Do you have any comment? Wang Wenbin: The Hong Kong police has responded to this and condemned her irresponsible behaviors that blatantly challenge law and order. China is a country with rule of law and Hong Kong is a law-based society where residentsâ lawful rights and interests are fully protected. That being said, no one is entitled to extrajudicial privileges and all offenders shall be brought to justice.  Xinhua News Agency: Can you brief us on this yearâs mechanism meetings between China and Singapore at the vice-premier level? What are the special highlights of this yearâs meetings? Wang Wenbin: The bilateral cooperation mechanisms between China and Singapore at the vice-premier level are the two sidesâ institutionalized communication channel at the highest level, playing an important role for years in promoting China-Singapore cooperation in various fields in a coordinating way and facilitating socioeconomic development of the two countries. This yearâs meetings to be held in Tianjin coincide with the 15th anniversary of the China-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City project and the two sides will hold commemorating activities. China and Singapore are each otherâs friendly neighbors and important partners, with a sound momentum of growth in bilateral relations. This March, President Xi Jinping and Singaporeâs Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong jointly announced to elevate China-Singapore relations to an all-round high-quality future-oriented partnership, providing strategic guidance for China-Singapore cooperation. This yearâs meetings are the first ones since the bilateral relationship was elevated. Thus the meetings have special significance. The two sides will focus on âall-roundâ, âhigh-qualityâ and âfuture-orientedâ in the characterization, deliver on the important common understandings between leaders of the two countries, further dovetail development strategies, fully advance high-quality cooperation and jointly act on the new characterization of China-Singapore relationship. Beijing Daily: On December 2, the first China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) was successfully concluded. We noted that many representatives from multinational corporations attending the expo said that holding the first CISCE demonstrates Chinaâs firm determination in taking concrete actions to deepen international cooperation on industrial and supply chains. What is your comment on this? Wang Wenbin: As the worldâs first national-level expo themed on supply chains, the first CISCE attracted 515 companies and institutions from both home and abroad. Available data shows that over 200 cooperation deals and tentative deals worth more than RMB 150 billion were signed at the expo. The CISCE is a grand event that connects the world for a shared future. It reflects the common aspiration of all parties for building stable and resilient industrial and supply chains, sends out a clear message of Chinaâs deeper engagement in building global industrial and supply chains, and shows that in global industrial and supply chain cooperation, China is not only a participant and beneficiary, but also a staunch defender and contributor. During the CISCE, the international business community launched the Beijing Initiative for the Connectivity of Industrial and Supply Chains. Companies from home and abroad connected by industrial and supply chains showcased their advancements, deepened cooperation and gained substantively from the CISCE. The supply chains should be chains of win-win cooperation. China stands ready to share opportunities with all sides that stem from its huge market, the most complete industrial sectors, high-level opening up policy, and innovation factors gathering at a faster pace. China stands ready to work with all sides to build global industrial and supply chains that are secure, stable, smooth, efficient, open, inclusive and mutually beneficial, and provide strong safeguards for boosting global growth and increasing the wellbeing of people around the world.  AFP: The Philippine government said recently that it is deeply concerned about the over 130 Chinese boats around Niuâe Jiao. French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said recently that France is concerned by what the Chinese warship did to the Australian ship. She added that âstability must prevail in the Taiwan Strait, and certainly the world doesnât need a new crisis.â What is your response to these? Wang Wenbin: On your first question, Niuâe Jiao is part of Chinaâs Nansha Qundao. Relevant waters of the South China Sea, including Niuâe Jiao and its adjacent waters, have always been important operating areas and shelters for Chinese fishing boats. It is justified and lawful for Chinese fishing boats to operate or shelter from wind in the area, and the Philippines is in no position to make irresponsible remarks. On your second question, you may refer to Chinaâs previous response. I would like to stress that the Taiwan question is purely Chinaâs internal affair, and the solid anchor to cross-Strait peace and stability is the one-China principle. We hope relevant parties will adhere to the one-China principle, stand firmly with China against Taiwan independence, and safeguard peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.â TASS: Yesterday Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko started his visit to China. Does the foreign ministry have any comment? How does the foreign ministry comment on Belarus and Chinaâs cooperative partnership? Wang Wenbin: China and Belarus are all-weather comprehensive strategic partners and the two sides maintain close exchanges at all levels. As for the details of President Lukashenkoâs visit, you may refer to the relevant press release the Chinese side has put out. Bloomberg: Finland has said that it will demand that its investigators be allowed on board the NewNew Polar Bear, a Hong Kong-flagged vessel whose anchor ripped up a sub-sea gas pipeline in October. Finlandâs President said that he requires that investigators from his country will be involved when the captain is questioned when he returns to China. How does the foreign ministry respond to this? Wang Wenbin: China always attaches great importance to protecting the safety and security of undersea infrastructure, and strictly fulfills its obligations under international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and relevant treaties of the International Maritime Organization. Relevant Chinese authorities are conducting technical investigation on the incident and maintaining smooth communication and good cooperation with parties concerned, including Finland, in accordance with international law. China Daily: On December 1, the High Constitutional Court of Madagascar announced the final result of the countryâs presidential election.

We believe that under the leadership of President Rajoelina, Madagascar will achieve greater success in national development and economic and social progress. China always values its traditional friendship with Madagascar. We stand ready to work with the new government of Madagascar to deepen and expand exchange and cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, and pursue new, greater development of the China-Madagascar comprehensive cooperative partnership.  Hubei Media Group: December 3 marks the second anniversary of the China-Laos Railway. Data shows the railway has served 24.2 million passengers and shipped 29.1 million tonnes of goods over the past two years, taking on an increasingly important role as a golden route. Do you have any comment? Wang Wenbin: Over the past two years, the China-Laos Railway has become an important engine for economic and trade cooperation as well as people-to-people exchanges between China and Laos, a road of happiness, development and friendship for the benefit of the Chinese and Laotian people, and an artery linking China and countries on the Indochina Peninsula. The China-Laos Railway freight service could reach 12 Belt and Road partner countries, including Laos, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Myanmar. The Lancang-Mekong Express international freight train of the China-Laos Railway now runs 400 trains with fixed point, time, route and train number. The new transport model of China-Laos Railway plus China-Europe Railway Express has shortened direct rail shipping time from countries like Laos and Thailand to Europe to 15 days. The railwayâs function as a major international corridor in increasing domestic and international connectivity, benefiting countries along the routes, leveraging complementarity of its destinations, and offering safe and efficient services is becoming more pronounced. We hope that the China-Laos Railway, as an engine for China and countries on the Indochina Peninsula to promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, will continue to run at top speed and drive the development and prosperity of more countries in the region. NHK: It is reported that the 24th China-EU Summit will be held in Beijing on December 7. Can you share more information and Chinaâs expectation? Wang Wenbin: The China-EU Summit is an annual meeting between the leaders of the two sides and provides strategic guidance for the development of China-EU relations. This yearâs summit coincides with the 20th anniversary of the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership and the 25th anniversary of the China-EU Summit mechanism. It is followed closely by people from various fields in China and the EU as well as the broader international community. China attaches high importance to the summit. President Xi Jinping will meet with the President of the European Council Charles Michel and the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen. Premier Li Qiang will co-host the summit with the two Presidents of the EU. Leaders from the two sides will have in-depth exchange of views on strategic issues critical to the direction of China-EU relations and global issues of mutual interest to draw a blueprint for, identity the focus of and inject impetus to China-EU relations. At present, the situation unseen in a century is evolving at a faster pace marked by increased volatility in international situation, sluggish world economy and emerging global challenges. The China-EU relationship is also facing new opportunities and challenges. China and the EU are partners, not rivals and our common interests far exceed differences. China hopes that the summit will play an important role by building on past achievements, enhance understanding and mutual trust through strategic communication, boost mutually beneficial cooperation through innovation, and discuss solutions through dialogue and consultation. China hopes that the two sides can work together to address global challenges, inject new impetus to the global economy, increase stability in international situation and provide strategic guidance for sustained and sound development of China-EU relations. This serves the fundamental and long-term interest of both China and the EU and meets the common aspiration of the international community. Shenzhen TV: The Israel Defence Forces issued a statement on December 1 saying that Hamas violated the temporary ceasefire deal and attacked Israel. Israel resumed combat operations against Hamas. On the same day, Israeli officials said that intelligence department of Israel is making plans to hunt down Hamas leaders living in Lebanon, TÃ¼rkiye and Qatar. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Wang Wenbin: China is deeply concerned over the resumed fighting in Gaza. Under the current situation, the goal of ending the hostilities should not change and the principle of protecting civilians should not be violated. Facts prove once again that the use of force will never bring lasting peace. Heavier civilian casualties will only create more hatred and hasten the next round of escalation. China strongly calls on relevant sides to exercise restraint and the international community, especially countries with influence on the Palestinian-Israeli issue, to earnestly play a responsible role, implement the Security Councilâs Resolution 2712 and the resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly at its emergency session, promote a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire, protect civilians, ease the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, resume talks for peace as soon as possible and work relentlessly for the peaceful co-existence between Palestine and Israel and lasting peace in the Middle East.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on December 1, 2023"," Reuters: Kyodo News has reported that a reporter for South China Morning Post who traveled to Beijing for the Xiangshan Forum from Hong Kong last month has not been reachable for several weeks. Kyodo citing people close to the matter said this reporter may be under investigation by mainland authorities. Is there anything that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has to offer regarding this situation? Wang Wenbin: Iâm not aware of that. Global Times: We noted that the OECD Economic Outlook issued recently revised up Chinaâs growth forecasts for this year and the next, expecting China to grow at 5.2 percent this year. China will remain a main driver for economic growth in the Asia-Pacific and the world. What is your comment on this? Wang Wenbin: We noted that recently many international organizations and financial institutions have revised up Chinaâs growth forecast for this year. Aside from the OECD, the IMF has increased the forecast to 5.4 percent, and many financial institutions such as JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Citibank, UBS, Deutsche Bank and ANZ have put it at 5 to 5.5 percent. It is widely believed that China is the biggest driver for the world economy and will contribute one third of global growth. Since early this year, China has seen continued rebound in its economy, with leading growth rate among major economies, and substantive progress in high-quality development. The world has looked to the Chinese market for more opportunities. The sixth China International Import Expo (CIIE) held last month saw the signing of tentative deals worth USD 78.41 billion, increasing by 6.7 percent compared with the previous CIIE. The second Global Digital Trade Expo witnessed the signing of projects with a total contract value of RMB 155.85 billion, surging by 316.7 percent from the first expo. The ongoing first China International Supply Chain Expo has attracted over 500 companies and institutions from both home and abroad. We welcome friends from the business communities of all countries to invest in China, explore Chinaâs market, and share in the new opportunities arising from Chinaâs high-quality development and high-level opening up. Reuters: Argentinaâs incoming Foreign Minister Diana Mondino on Thursday said the country will not join the BRICS grouping of developing nations. Has China reached out to the incoming Milei administration as the President-elect will be in power and have the final say over its BRICS membership? Wang Wenbin: BRICS is an important platform for stronger solidarity and cooperation among emerging markets and developing countries to uphold common interest. It is an open platform. We welcome all countries that are interested to become a member of the BRICS family. Shenzhen TV: According to reports, on November 29, many British visitors braved the bitter cold to bid farewell to giant pandas Yang Guang and Tian Tian in Edinburgh, who will soon return to China. Many British people are reluctant to see the giant pandas go and care about whether China and the UK will continue to cooperate on giant pandas. What is your comment on this? Wang Wenbin: Since launching the cooperation on giant panda conservation and research in 2011, China and the UK have maintained a sound cooperation relationship and achieved positive outcomes in the conservation and management, scientific research, technological exchange and public education regarding giant pandas. This has played an important role in enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and British peoples. In accordance with the terms in the cooperation agreement signed between China and the UK, Yang Guang and Tian Tian, the two giant pandas, will return to China after the agreement expire in December. The Chinese side has made good preparations to welcome them home. In the future, China stands ready to continue to strengthen cooperation with the UK and other international partners on the protection of endangered species and biodiversity and enhance the friendship between people in China and other countries in the world.  Peopleâs Daily: November 28 marks the 10th anniversary of the China-Europe Railway Express (Xiâan), which has seen over 20,000 trips, accounting for a quarter of all trips made under the Railway Express. How do you see the role played by the China-Europe Railway Express in promoting the economic development of countries along the routes?â Wang Wenbin: Over the past decade, the China-Europe Railway Express has grown into a bustling network, contributing to keeping global industrial and supply chains stable and injecting new impetus into the world economic development. It has become a flagship project and a signature brand of Belt and Road cooperation.â The Railway Express has built a new land transportation corridor, promoting win-win cooperation in Eurasia. It runs through more than 100 cities in 11 Asian countries and regions and reaches more than 200 cities in 25 European countries. Thanks to its development, the cargo transportation time between China and Europe can be shortened by more than 20 days from shipping by sea, which means quality products from China and Europe can reach each otherâs markets more quickly. Over the past decade, with strong demand for cross-border transport, a total of 81,000 trips were made under the Railway Express, covering over 700 million kilometers. It has shipped more than 7.6 million TEUs of goods worth over USD 340 billion, giving a strong boost to international economic and trade cooperation, promoting economic development and livelihood improvement in countries and regions along the routes, and contributing to the unfettered operation of global industrial and supply chains. The China-Europe Railway Express is a vivid example of the steady progress in Belt and Road cooperation. With expanding sources of goods and more high-tech products, the Railway Express is transforming from featuring a simple corridor economy to a value-added one. It is benefiting countries and regions along the routes with high-quality development. The China-Europe Railway Express originates from China, connects Asia and Europe, and benefits the whole world. President Xi Jinping announced at the opening ceremony of the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation that China will speed up high-quality development of the China-Europe Railway Express. China will continue to work with partners in Asia and Europe to usher in another decade of a two-way journey full of opportunities and to embrace a bright future of high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. CCTV: Franceâs Jacques Delors Institute recently released a report saying that for the EU, leveraging China to realize its own development is a necessary choice. The report called on the EU to always be rational on âde-riskingâ, uphold a more rational and pragmatic China policy, and enhance mutually beneficial cooperation in energy, the green sector and technology. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Wang Wenbin: We noted the report you mentioned which reflects that people with insights in Europe are positive about the prospect of growing China-EU relations and that the relationship enjoys solid foundation in the people. China and the EU are partners, not rivals. China-EU cooperation should be a positive cycle that enables our mutual success, not a knock-out match which results in only one winner. Certain individuals selectively emphasize on competing aspects between China and the EU, deliberately overlook partnerships and hype up âde-riskingâ with China and reducing dependence on China. Such misconception on China not only will reinforce misunderstanding and erode mutual trust, but also goes against the EUâs long-held position of upholding free trade and WTO rules and disrupts the growth of China-EU relations, which does not serve any oneâs interests. China believes that the risk that we need to get rid of the most is confrontation and rivalry caused by politicizing all issues and the dependence that needs to be reduced the most is the act of resorting to protectionism. China and the EU are important parts of the global industrial and supply chains and staunch force in building an open world economy. We hope that the EU side can listen to rational voices, steer clear of politicizing all issues or overstretching the concept of security, and work with China to maintain two-way opening up instead of erecting walls and barriers, promote trade and investment liberalization instead of trade protectionism, create a fair, equitable, and non-discriminatory business environment for companies of both sides, advance sound and steady growth of China-EU relationship and inject more stability and certainty for a volatile and turbulent world.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on November 30, 2023"," At the invitation of Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Tran Luu Quang, Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi will be in Viet Nam from December 1 to 2 to hold the 15th Meeting of the China-Viet Nam Steering Committee for Bilateral Cooperation. CCTV: Yesterday marks the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. Under Chinaâs initiation as this monthâs rotating president, the UN Security Council held the High-Level Meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli Issue. Can you give us more information about the meeting and outcomes? Wang Wenbin: Since the latest round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict, China has all along devoted its efforts to realizing peace and saving lives. President Xi Jinping made clear Chinaâs principled position on the current Palestinian-Israeli situation on a number of occasions. China is this monthâs rotating president of the Security Council. On November 15, the first resolution since this round of Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out was adopted under Chinaâs presidency, beginning initial steps toward a ceasefire. On November 29 local time, the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, under Chinaâs initiation, the Security Council held a High-Level Meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli Issue. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi chaired the meeting. Foreign Ministers and high-level representatives of nearly 20 countries, including Brazil, Palestine, Qatar, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Indonesia, TÃ¼rkiye, Slovenia and Malaysia, and all members of the Security Council attended the meeting. Foreign Ministers of many countries traveled to New York for the meeting. UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres and Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Tor Wennesland made briefings to the meeting. Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed that dialogue and negotiation is the best way to save lives and the fundamental way to settle disagreements. We should work for a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire with the greatest urgency. There is no safe area under gunfire and no firewall in Gaza. China strongly hopes that the temporary ceasefire will not be a pause before a new round of offensives but the beginning of new efforts for realizing comprehensive and lasting ceasefire. A comprehensive and lasting ceasefire should be the overriding priority. We should protect civilians with more practical and robust efforts. Any violence and attack against civilians is unacceptable and any violation of the international humanitarian law needs to be condemned. It is imperative to fully deliver on the Security Councilâs Resolution 2712. The Chinese government will provide another batch of emergency humanitarian supplies to Gaza. We should be more determined to revitalize the political prospect of the two-state solution. The justice of the Palestinian issue lies in the two-state solution, which is irreplaceable. Only when the two-state solution is truly and fully implemented, can peace in the Middle East be realized. China calls for an international peace conference that is more broad-based and effective. China supports Palestine in becoming a full member of the United Nations. We should galvanize more responsible and meaningful actions in the Security Council. China submitted the Position Paper of the Peopleâs Republic of China on Resolving the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict. We will continue to enhance coordination with relevant parties to pool consensus and make sure that the Security Council will undertake its due responsibility to work for peace and speak up for justice. After the meeting is closed, Foreign Minister Wang Yi made remarks to the media, pointing out that on the Palestinian issue, China remains on the side of peace, justice and conscience and will continue to work with relevant parties to enhance coordination, pool consensus and work relentlessly for restoring stability in the region and a peaceful life for the people. All sides commended Chinaâs initiation of holding the High-Level Meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli Issue and recognized the meeting as the first event to deliver on the Security Councilâs Resolution 2712. The meeting is of important significance for promoting a ceasefire and easing the humanitarian crisis and helps parties to pool insights, consensus and synergy. It is widely supported to extend the temporary ceasefire until a lasting ceasefire is realized, release those held captive, protect civilians, reinforce humanitarian assistance and ensure unimpeded access for supplies. We hope that the Security Council can earnestly fulfill its responsibility in safeguarding international peace and security, play a bigger role to ease the tensions, resume peace process as soon as possible and realize peaceful co-existence between Palestine and Israel. On the sidelines of the meeting, Foreign Minister Wang Yi held meetings with UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres, Sloveniaâs Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tanja Fajon, Brazilâs Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira and Malaysiaâs Minister of Foreign Affairs Zambry Abd Kadir respectively, and had a group meeting with foreign ministers of Arab and Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, TÃ¼rkiye and Indonesia. China Daily: Recently, the EU is preparing the EU-China Summit. We have also noticed that the EU raises concerns to China over its economic slowdown, poor business environment, overcapacity, imbalance in trade, and its pursuit of a China-centered international order and emphasized no decoupling from but âde-riskingâ with China. Do you have any comment? Wang Wenbin: The concerns raised by the EU are inconsistent with the facts. Despite difficulties in global economic recovery, China maintains a good momentum toward stabilizing and improving its economy, which is not easy. In the first three quarters, Chinaâs GDP has gone up by 5.2 percent year on year, making China a leader among the major economies. Many international organizations have revised up the expectations for Chinaâs economy recently. China is pursuing high-quality development and actively building a market-oriented, law-based and internationalized business environment. According to the survey for the third quarter by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, more than 80 percent of participating foreign companies are satisfied with the business environment, and close to 90 percent of the companies expect their return on investment to remain flat or increase in next five years. China has never sought trade surplus. China has actively held the China International Import Expo (CIIE) and the China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE), working for the opening up with more market opportunities and consolidating and advancing global cooperation on industrial and supply chains. Chinaâs new development will create new opportunities for Europe and the rest of the world. The rapid development of Chinaâs green industry and clean technology is the result of painstaking efforts in pursuing technological innovation and building complete industrial and supply chains and is the legitimate advantage won by strenuous efforts and fair competition. This is welcomed by EU consumers and global users and has made tremendous contribution to global efforts in addressing climate change and promoting green transition. The Chinese modernization is the modernization on the path of peaceful development. China has been committed to the UN-centered international system, the international order underpinned by international law, and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and advanced a global governance vision featuring wide consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the China-EU comprehensive strategic partnership. The experience of the past two decades has shown that staying committed to the comprehensive strategic partnership will charter China-EU relations forward. From curbing inflation to promoting economic recovery, from realizing green transition and digital transformation to strengthening strategic independence, from safeguarding multilateralism to addressing global challenges, China is a reliable partner to the EU. âDe-riskingâ and âreducing dependenceâ should not evolve into throwing away and weakening cooperation. It is hoped that the EU will observe Chinaâs development and domestic and foreign policies in a comprehensive and objective way, adopts a rational and pragmatic China policy, and promotes the mutually beneficial cooperation between the two sides, so as to jointly resolve global challenges.  Reuters: Taiwan âpresidentâ Tsai Ing-wen has told The New York Times in an interview that Chinaâs leadership is too âoverwhelmedâ with its internal problems to consider an invasion of Taiwan. She said this was not a time to consider a major invasion largely because of Chinaâs internal economic, financial and political challenges, and also because the international community has been clear that war is not an option. Would the ministry comment on this interview? Wang Wenbin: I need to correct you first. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and there is no such thing as âTaiwanese presidentâ. This is not a question about foreign affairs. Let me stress that there is only one China in the world. The Taiwan question is Chinaâs internal affair and standing up for the one-China principle is a prevailing consensus among the international community. To ensure cross-Strait peace and stability, it is essential to unequivocally uphold the one-China principle and oppose âTaiwan independenceâ and foreign interference. The DPP authoritiesâ obsession with the separatist position of âTaiwan independenceâ and provocations to pursue âTaiwan independenceâ will only end in a shameful failure.â Xinhua News Agency: The UN held a Special Commemorative Meeting for the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People on November 29. President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to the meeting. Can you share more about this and the role China will play in resolving the Palestinian question? Wang Wenbin: China has always been a sincere friend of Palestine and stood together with the Palestinian people. On November 29, President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to the UN Special Commemorative Meeting for the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. This is the 11th time that President Xi Jinping sent a congratulatory message to the annual meeting. This speaks to Chinaâs firm support for the Palestinian peopleâs just cause of restoring the nationâs legitimate rights and interests. It also shows Chinaâs commitment to our responsibility of upholding fairness and justice in international affairs. Given the current situation, this yearâs commemorative meeting is of special significance. As President Xi Jinping noted in the congratulatory message, the question of Palestine lies at the heart of the Middle East issue. It is a matter of international fairness and justice. The international community must act now and urgently. The UN Security Council must take on its responsibility and do all it can to push for ceasefire, protect civilians, and end the humanitarian disaster. Palestinian-Israeli peace talks should be resumed on that basis as soon as possible. The Palestiniansâ right to statehood, right to existence, and right of return must be realized at the earliest date. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, China will continue to work with the rest of the international community to build consensus for peace, get the question of Palestine back on the right track of the two-state solution, and seek an early resolution that is comprehensive, just and durable. CRI: We noted that China has released the Position Paper of the Peopleâs Republic of China on Resolving the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict. Could you share more information on that? Wang Wenbin: The current Palestinian-Israeli conflictâhas causedâheavy civilian casualties andâa serious humanitarian disaster. China always stands on the side of peace, justice and human conscience. As this monthâs president of the Security Council, China has actively promoted talks for peace and galvanized responsible and meaningful actions in the Security Council. In the Position Paper of the Peopleâs Republic of China on Resolving the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, China offers proposals in five respects, including implementing a comprehensive ceasefire and ending the fighting, protectingâciviliansâeffectively, ensuringâhumanitarian assistance, enhancing diplomatic mediation and seeking political settlement through the two-state solution. China will continue to strengthen coordination with parties concerned, further build consensus and make unremitting effort for ending the conflict, resuming peace talks and facilitating a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the question of Palestine.â  AFP: Former US Secretary Kissinger passed away. Whatâs Chinaâs comment on this? What will the Chinese government remember about him and miss the most? Wang Wenbin: Dr. Henry Kissinger was a dear old friend of the Chinese people and a trail-blazer and contributor to China-US relations. Dr. Kissinger, who has long been showing care and support for the growth of China-US relations, visited China more than 100 times and has made historical contribution to the normalization of China-US relations. He will be greatly missed and fondly remembered by the people of China for his personal commitment and extraordinary contribution to China-US relations. Chinese President Xi Jinping has sent a message of condolences to President Biden to express deep sorrow over the passing of Dr. Kissinger and extend sympathies to Dr. Kissingerâs family. Premier Li Qiang sent a message of condolences to the family of Dr. Kissinger. Director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Minister Wang Yi sent a message of condolences to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Dr. Kissinger attached high importance to China-US relations and stated that this bilateral relationship is of vital significance to both China and the US and global peace and prosperity. Both sides in China and the US need to carry forward Dr. Kissingerâs strategic vision, political courage and diplomatic wisdom and, as President Xi and President Biden agreed in San Francisco, uphold the principle of mutual respect, peaceful co-existence and win-win cooperation and work to deliver a healthy, stable and sustainable China-US relationship. Antara: Based on a report, Taiwanâs health department today urged the elderly, the very young and those with poor immunity to avoid traveling to China due to the recent increase in respiratory illness in Chinese mainland. Does the ministry have any comment about it? Wang Wenbin: This is not a question about foreign affairs.â Chinaâs National Health Commission (NHC) has held a press conference to share information on relevant matter. It is safe to travel, do business and study here in China and thereâs no need to worry. Dragon TV: Recently China Railway rolled out an online identity verification service for foreign passport holders. The railwayâs website 12306.cn and its app have also launched English versions and provided a number of facilitation measures for foreign passengers traveling by rail. Do you have any comment on this? Wang Wenbin: China is committed to enhancing people-to-people exchange with other countries and has worked to facilitate foreigners traveling, working, studying and living in China. The measures that China Railway rolled out recently are aimed at providing better services for foreign passengers. China will open its door wider. We welcome more foreign friends to visit China and travel around, perhaps by high-speed rail, to experience first-hand Chinaâs high-quality development and high-level opening up.  Reuters: Lithuaniaâs foreign minister said on Tuesday that China had lifted trade measures restricting Lithuaniaâs exports to China. Can you confirm that normal trade relations between China and Lithuania have been restored? What triggered this decision? Wang Wenbin: China always follows WTO rules and will handle relevant issue in accordance with rules. We once again urge the Lithuanian side to correct mistakes and return to the one-China principle as soon as possible. The Paper: Recently, 34 US think tanks and non-governmental organizations jointly sent a letter to Chinese and US presidents, calling on the two countries to be committed to reducing frictions in the bilateral relations and enhance cooperation in protecting the Earth and safeguarding world peace and prosperity. Do you have any comment? Wang Wenbin: The letter of 34 US think tanks and non-governmental organizations to Chinese and US presidents sent out a voice of reason for China-US relations and reflected the sincere call from all sectors of the American society for stabilizing and improving China-US relations and assuming due responsibilities as major countries. During the meeting in San Francisco, the two heads of state had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on strategic and overarching issues critical to the direction of China-US relations and on major issues affecting world peace and development. They held further discussions about the right way for China and the US to get along, clearly outlined the shared responsibilities of our two major countries, and came up with a future-oriented âSan Francisco visionâ, yielding a series of common understandings and deliverables. This also reflects and represents the shared aspiration of the two peoples and the international community. As President Xi Jinping pointed out at the welcome dinner hosted by friendly organizations in the US, no matter how the global landscape evolves, the historical trend of peaceful coexistence between China and the US will not change. The ultimate wish of our two peoples for exchanges and cooperation will not change. The expectations of the whole world for a steadily growing China-US relationship will not change. We hope that the two peoples across various sectors will continue to work together and make more visits, contacts and exchanges, so as to form greater synergy to promote sound, stable, and sustainable development of the China-US relationship and safeguard world peace and prosperity.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on November 29, 2023"," CCTV: We noted that the first China International Supply Chain Expo opened in Beijing yesterday morning. Premier Li Qiang delivered a keynote speech at the opening ceremony and put forward a four-point proposal on deepening international cooperation on industrial and supply chains. Hours earlier, the US announced the establishment of the White House Council on Supply Chain Resilience to reduce reliance on âhigh-risk foreign suppliersâ. Analysts are seeing two diverging trajectories on global industrial and supply chains, with China representing openness and the US isolation. Whatâs your comment? Wang Wenbin: As President Xi Jinping noted, maintaining the resilience and stability of global industrial and supply chains is an important guarantee for the promotion of global economic development, and serves the common interests of people around the world. The China International Supply Chain Expo is the worldâs first national exhibition themed on supply chain. It is also a new platform for China to advance high-level opening-up and foster an open world economy. A total of 515 Chinese and foreign businesses and institutions are participating in the expo. Overseas companies account for 26 percent of the total, and US exhibitors, including Fortune 500 and multinational corporations like Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Intel and Qualcomm, take up 20 percent of all overseas companies.â Premier Li Qiang attended the opening ceremony of the expo yesterday and delivered a keynote speech. He noted that China is not only a participant and beneficiary of global industrial and supply chain cooperation, but also a staunch defender and builder. China stands ready to work with all parties to build more resilient, efficient and dynamic global industrial and supply chains and contribute more to world economic recovery and global development and prosperity. Premier Li put forward a four-point proposal on deepening international cooperation on industrial and supply chains. He called for joint efforts to build a global industrial and supply chain system that is secure, stable, smooth, efficient, open, inclusive and mutually beneficial and expressed the hope that entrepreneurs around the world will play a positive role in safeguarding the sound operation of global industrial and supply chains. China will offer more facilitation and better services for foreign businesses investing or operating in China. You mentioned two trajectories in the world, openness versus isolation. Chinaâs choice is staying committed to advancing high-level opening-up and building an open world economy. The Associated Press: Supporters of the government in Myanmar say that the Chinese government is supporting the rebel offensive in the Shan State. Thereâs even been protest in Myanmar against China because of this belief. Experts say that the fighting could only be happening if China allows it to happen. Can you comment on whether China is supporting the brotherhood alliance and the offensive in Myanmar? Wang Wenbin: China and Myanmar are friendly neighbors. China has always respected Myanmarâs sovereignty and territorial integrity, sincerely hoped for stability and development in the country, and firmly supported Myanmar in advancing the peace process. Any attempt to sow discord and undermine the âpauk-phawâ friendship between our two countries will not win support or succeed.  Bloomberg: Will Foreign Minister Wang Yi be visiting Viet Nam from Thursday? Wang Wenbin: I have nothing to offer at the moment. Beijing Daily: The report launched by the United Nations Environment Programme finds that nations must go further than current Paris pledges or face global warming of 2.5-2.9 degrees Celsius. Does China agree with the view? What efforts would be made to achieve the Paris Agreement goals as scheduled?â Wang Wenbin: I have noted the report you mentioned. In recent years, extreme weather events are rampant with acute negative impacts. The report reminds us again that global efforts to address climate change are far from enough. Consensus has been reached under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement on the principles and goals of the global climate response. The main goal is to limit global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. To achieve this goal, the Convention and the Agreement also call on developed countries to take the lead in drastically cutting their carbon emissions and provide support in finance, technology and capacity-building for climate actions of developing countries. Developing countries should also actively contribute strength to addressing climate change.â As a responsible major developing country, China has over-shot the climate action targets of 2020 ahead of schedule, will make the steepest cuts in the world to the intensity of our carbon emissions, and will complete the process from carbon emissions peaking to carbon neutrality in the shortest span of time, actively contributing our strength to global climate governance. The climate policies and objectives that China has adopted now are fully consistent with the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.â However, the mitigation efforts from developed countries are far from enough. They should take the lead in drastically increasing their efforts in emissions reduction, reach net zero carbon emissions much earlier than 2050, and create space for developing countries to achieve sustainable development goals. Developed countries also need to take credible steps to fully fulfill their obligations of supporting developing countries in finance, technology and capacity-building, realizing the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement with concrete actions. The upcoming COP28 will see the first-ever global stocktake of the Paris Agreement, which is highly anticipated by all parties. We hope that this global stocktake will focus on implementation, fully assess the collective progress of realizing goals set in the Paris Agreement, evaluate the gap between developed countriesâ targets and actions and their obligations in cutting emissions, identify the gap between the needs of developing countries and the support provided, and earnestly urge developed countries to deliver on their promises. We hope that COP28 will take the global stocktake as an opportunity to act on multilateralism with the UN at its core, fully address developing countriesâ concerns, advance a just green transition pragmatically and respond to climate change with solidarity and cooperation so as to create more favorable conditions to implement the Convention and the Agreement and send a positive message of focusing on action and cooperation to the international community. AFP: Closing arguments are due to begin in Hong Kong today in the trial of 47 pro-democracy activists, who were arrested under the National Security Law passed in 2020. Does the foreign ministry have any comment on the trial today? Wang Wenbin: What you mentioned is not a matter of foreign affairs. Let me reiterate that Hong Kong is a society with the rule of law. We support Hong Kong SARâs judiciary in performing duties in accordance with law.â  Yomiuri Shimbun: Yesterday Japanese Ambassador to China Hideo Tarumi paid a consular visit to the Japanese national detained in Beijing in March this year. This is the first time that a Japanese ambassador to China paid a consular visit to a Japanese national detained in China, and the Japanese government is following this case closely. What is your comment on this? Wang Wenbin: In accordance with the stipulations of relevant international conventions and the China-Japan Consular Agreement, China has arranged the consular visit by officials from the Japanese Embassy in China. Relevant Chinese authorities adopted compulsory measures in accordance with the criminal procedure law against the Japanese citizen suspected of engaging in espionage activities. China is a country under the rule of law.â The case concerned will be handled in accordance with the law and the lawful rights and interests of the person concerned will be protected accordingly. NHK: Recently, hospitals across China have seen an increase in the number of outpatient and emergency visits, which has caught the attention of the WHO and the international community. Does the foreign ministry have any response to this? Wang Wenbin: On November 26, Chinaâs National Health Commission (NHC) held a press conference to share information on the prevention and treatment of respiratory infectious diseases in winter. The NHC has had communication in a timely manner with the WHO. You may refer to relevant information that is readily available.â CCTV: According to reports by Canadaâs The Globe and Mail,â Michael Spavor, who is suspected of engaging in espionage activities in China, said he provided Michael Kovrig with sensitive information about the DPRK, which was later passed on to the Canadian government and its Five Eyes spy-service partners unbeknownst to Michael Spavor. This led to the arrests of the two persons in China. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Wang Wenbin: Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are suspected of criminal acts endangering Chinaâs national security. Chinese judicial authorities handled the case in strict accordance with the law. The false accusation against China of âarbitrary detentionâ was a complete distortion of facts and blame-shifting. Stories made up by the Canadian side have been debunked by facts over time. This is the result of Canadaâs own doing. We urge the Canadian side to respect facts, deeply reflect upon its mistakes and stop misleading public opinion, and smearing China.â "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on November 28, 2023"," CCTV: We noted that the UAE will hold the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) in Dubai from November 30 to December 12 this year. Can you share Chinaâs expectation for the conference? Wang Wenbin: COP28, which will open at the end of this month, will see the first-ever global stocktake since the Paris Agreement came into effect. It will be of milestone significance. China highly commends the UAEâs leading role as the host of COP28 in advancing green and low-carbon development and galvanizing global joint response to climate change. President Xi Jinpingâs Special Representative, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Ding Xuexiang will attend the World Climate Action Summit in the UAE. China will work with all parties to support the UAEâs presidency and use the global stocktake as an opportunity to step up implementation, strengthen supporting measures and jointly build a fair, reasonable and win-win global climate governance system. China Daily: The Global AI Governance Initiative China put forward not long ago has drawn extensive attention around the world. Can you share more with us? Wang Wenbin: President Xi Jinping announced Chinaâs Global AI Governance Initiative at the opening ceremony of the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation. The Initiative has received high attention and positive comments from the international community. It is widely recognized that the Initiative fully embodies the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind, meets countriesâ need for AI development, and has made unique contribution to the healthy, safe and orderly development of AI. Some developing countries noted that AI rules-making cannot be determined by a few developed countries. It is important to increase the say of the Global South and build a fair and equitable international governance system in the area of AI. Many countries have expressed their willingness to enhance exchange and cooperation with China in AI. China stands ready to take the implementation of the Initiative as an opportunity to carry out communication, exchange and practical cooperation with various parties on global AI governance, and ensure that AI develops in a way that advances human civilization. Shenzhen TV: Itâs reported that as the ocean discharge of the Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water started by the Japanese government enters the third month, TEPCO recently started damage identification and compensation of domestic victims of the ocean discharge. Whatâs your comment? Wang Wenbin: The ocean discharge of Japanâs Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water bears on the health of all humanity, the global marine environment and the international public interest. Japan needs to take seriously domestic and international concerns in the same manner, especially strong concerns of neighboring countries, communicate with stakeholders with a responsible and constructive attitude and address seriously the legitimate demand for damage identification and compensation from stakeholders. With more Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water being dumped into the sea, the Japanese side must engage in full, sincere consultations with stakeholders, especially its neighbors, put in place a long-term monitoring arrangement as soon as possible that is carried out in a comprehensive, effective and independent manner and involves all stakeholders, so as to avoid irrevocable consequences stemming from the ocean discharge.  Reuters: Three Chinese navy ships have arrived in Myanmar on a goodwill visit. Are there any updates on the situation in Myanmar? What is Chinaâs assessment of the situation at the current time? Wang Wenbin: On November 27, the 44th Chinese naval escort taskforce arrived in Yangon, Myanmar, for a four-day friendly visit. This is a normal military exchange between China and Myanmar. As to Chinaâs position on the conflict in northern Myanmar you mentioned, weâve shared it with you on multiple occasions. China is closely following the conflict. We call on relevant parties to cease fire as soon as possible, settle disputes in a peaceful manner through dialogue and consultation, avoid escalation of the situation, and take effective measures to ensure the security and stability of China-Myanmar border areas. Antara: The World Health Organization says it has requested more information on an increase in respiratory illness and pneumonia cluster among children. Although Chinese health authorities have not detected any unusual or novel pathogens, there are increasing concerns among the international public about the safety of traveling to China as well as people who travel from China. What is the ministryâs response? Wang Wenbin: As for your question, Chinaâs National Health Commission (NHC) has held a press conference in a timely manner. The NHC and the National Administration of Disease Prevention and Control, at the request of the WHO, has arranged for exchanges between experts and the WHO on the recent situation of respiratory infectious diseases. If you are interested in any specifics, I would refer you to the competent authorities. Let me assure you that it is safe to travel and do business here in China and thereâs no need to worry. Reuters: Britainâs investment minister Dominic Johnson said he was working to attract Chinese car manufacturers to build a factory in Britain and that investment from China was crucial for Britain to meet environmental targets. How does China view these remarks? Have there been any ongoing talks? What are the progress on these talks?â Wang Wenbin: China and the UK are both major economies in the world. Cooperation in business, trade and investment between the two sides helps to achieve common development and contributes to global growth and prosperity. China stands ready to work with the UK on the basis of mutual respect and win-win cooperation to leverage respective strengths, expand cooperation in business, trade and investment, and promote green growth. We hope that the UK will work with China in the same direction and make concrete efforts to provide a fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese businesses to invest and operate in the UK.  China News Service: We noted that construction of the Al Dhafra PV2 Solar Power Plant in the UAE, contracted by a Chinese company, fully completed recently. The UAE side noted that this is of great significance as the country is about to host the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28). Do you have any comment? Wang Wenbin: The Al Dhafra PV2 Solar Power Plant is the worldâs largest single PV project and an important project of Belt and Road cooperation in the area of green energy. According to reports, the plant can supply power for 200,000 households, reduce 2.4 million tonnes of carbon emissions per year, and raise the ratio of clean energy in the UAEâs overall energy structure to over 13 percent. Rows of PV components have formed an âenergy oasisâ in Abu Dhabiâs desert. China is a doer in advancing global climate governance. We have not only built the worldâs largest clean power generation network, but also provided support and assistance in this regard to other developing countries to the best of our capability. Aside from the UAEâs Al Dhafra PV2 Solar Power Plant, China has undertaken other clean energy projects, such as the Sachal wind power project in Pakistan, the Noor III solar-thermal power plant in Morocco, the Al Kharsaah PV power station in Qatar and the Garissa PV power plant in Kenya. All these are vivid examples of China acting on the vision of green development, supporting the green and low-carbon construction and operation of infrastructure and enhancing international cooperation in climate response. COP28 will open soon in Dubai. We support the UAE in making the event a success. We will continue to synergize the green Silk Road with the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, deepen practical cooperation in green infrastructure and green energy, and contribute more to the low-carbon and green development in all countries. Reuters: The New York Times reported that the CIA and other American spy agencies have issued warnings about an Emirati firm G42 working with large Chinese companies including Huawei that US officials consider as security threats. US officials are also worried that the advanced American technology could be siphoned to Chinese companies or the government via this Emirati firm. The report also says that the US has even pointed to the prospect of sanctioning this Emirati firm. Our question is: Has the Emirati firm G42 raised these matters with China? Has any of the Chinese firms also brought this to the governmentâs attention? How does China respond to this report? Wang Wenbin: Iâm not aware of the specifics you mentioned. I would like to stress that the US has sabotaged cooperation between Chinese companies and other countries on multiple occasions under hypothetical pretexts, which is economic coercion. When asked by relevant countries to provide credible proof for the so-called âsecurity threatâ, the US has been stammering around or giving ambiguous answers.ââ China always opposes the US overstretching the concept of national security, politicizing and weaponizing economic and trade issues or approaching them from an untenable security angle, and obstructing normal investment activities in the industrial community and private sectors. Such moves by the US undermine international economic order and trade rules and threaten the stability of global industrial and supply chains. Those attempts find little support and will not get anywhere. "
"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbinâs Regular Press Conference on November 27, 2023"," As the rotating president of the UN Security Council for November, China will hold a Security Council high-level meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli issue on November 29. Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi will travel to New York to chair the meeting. Xinhua News Agency:âCould you elaborate on the considerations behind the Security Council high-level meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli issue to be chaired by Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Chinaâs expectation for the meeting?â WangâWenbin: The latest round of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict has caused massive civilian casualties and a humanitarian disaster. The international community has been watching the situation with great concern and looks to the UN Security Council to fulfill itsâprimary responsibility for maintaining international peace and securityâand play a constructive role.â The Security Council adopted Resolution 2712 on the Palestinian-Israeli issue not long ago, which is the first Security Council resolution adopted after the latest round of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict broke out and also the first Security Council resolution on the Palestinian-Israeli issue adopted since the end of 2016. It started initial steps towards promoting a ceasefire and is conducive to averting an even graver humanitarian crisis and disaster. As the rotating president of the UN Security Council for November, China hopes that, by holding this Security Council high-level meeting on the Palestinian-Israeli issue, we can do our part by bringing parties together for in-depth exchanges to build up consensus and take further concrete steps to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, realize ceasefire and cessation of hostilities, protect civilians and ultimately promote the comprehensive, just andâlasting settlement of the Palestinian question through the two-state solution.â Yonhap News Agency:âThe ROK-China-Japan Trilateral Foreign MinistersââMeeting was held inâtheâROKâyesterday. Chinaâs readout released by the foreign ministry says that the three sides agreed to create conditions for a leadersââmeeting of China, Japan and the ROK. Can you specify the conditions for the leadersââmeeting? Wang Wenbin:âThe 10thâChina-Japan-ROK Trilateral Foreign MinistersââMeeting was held in Busan, the ROK yesterday. The three sides agreed that it is importantâtoâdeliver on the consensus reached by leaders, including the Trilateral Cooperation Vision for the Next Decade. The three sides agreed to create conditions for a China-Japan-ROK leadersââmeeting and speed up preparation. The three sides need to work together inâtheâsameâdirectionâand create a favorable environment for achieving positive outcomes at the leadersââmeeting.â Taking this opportunity, I would like to brief you on the China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Foreign MinistersââMeeting. On November 26,âMember of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi attended theâ10thâChina-Japan-ROK Trilateral Foreign Ministersâ Meeting withâROKâForeign Minister Park Jin and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa in Busan,âthe ROK. This is the first China-Japan-ROK Trilateral Foreign MinistersââMeeting in four years. Foreign Minister Wang said that as we are renewing the trilateral cooperation, we need to keep in mind our original aspiration and stick to the right direction and implement our leadersââcommon understandings including the Trilateral Cooperation Vision for the Next Decade. The top priority is to continue to respect each otherâs development path and core interests in the spirit of facing up to history and looking forward to the future, maintain sound bilateral relations, and lay a solid foundation for a comprehensive restart of trilateral cooperation featuring steady and long-term progress. The three countries need to stick to mutual benefit and win-win results, restart negotiations on the trilateral free trade agreement among China, Japan and the ROK as soon as possible and maintain the momentum of regional economic integration. The three countries need to continue to deepen scientific and technological innovation, keep the industrial and supply chains stable and smooth and optimize and upgrade them. The three countries need to strengthen exchanges and cooperation, expand people-to-people exchanges, facilitate cross-border travels and jointly address common challenges such as climate change. The three countries need to pursue common development, continue to build more Trilateral+X Cooperation projects based on the principles of voluntariness, equality, openness, win-win results, transparency and sustainability, and promote common and sustainable development both inside and outside of the region. Park Jinâand Kamikawa Yoko spoke positively of the progress of China-Japan-ROK cooperation, noting that the three countries are close neighbors and the trilateral cooperation has great significance and enormous potential. In face of the new situation, the three countries need to think about what we hope to achieve through cooperation, step up communication and exchange, work closely together in various fields, and bring more tangible outcomes for the peoples of the three countries. China-Japan-ROK cooperation can reach beyond Northeast Asia and contribute to peace and prosperity in the region and the world. The ROK and Japan are open to China-Japan-ROK+X cooperation to benefit more countries and regions. Amid changes and instabilities in the world and the sluggish world economic recovery, countries in the region and beyond have stronger aspirations for solidarity, coordination and common development. Foreign Minister Wang Yi noted that as important countries in the Asia-Pacific, China, Japan and the ROK need to act in the interest of peace and development and the wellbeing of the people in the region, deepen regional cooperation, jointly respond to risks and challenges and safeguard the regionâs peace and prosperity. The three countries need to act as frontrunners of East Asia cooperation, drive East Asia cooperation through cooperation among the three countries, uphold open regionalism, oppose drawing ideological lines, andârejectâblocs in regional cooperation. The three countries need to act as stabilizers for the regionâs peace and security, act on the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and address differences and disputes in peaceful ways through dialogue and consultation. The three countries need to act as relief valves in addressing hotspot issues.âContinued tensionsâon the Korean Peninsula do not serve the interest of any side. It is imperative to cool down the situation, create conditions needed to resume dialogue and adopt meaningful actions.â Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed thatâChina will continue to uphold the policy of building friendship and partnership with its neighbors and work with the ROK and Japan to bring the trilateral cooperation back to the right track, maintain sound and steady sustainable development and make new contribution to regional and global peace and prosperity.  CCTV:âFromâNovember 23 to 24, French ForeignâMinisterâCatherine Colonnaâpaid a visit to China andâthe 6th meeting of the China-France high-level dialogue mechanism on people-to-people exchangesâwas held in Beijing. Do you have more information to share about the visit and the outcomes of the meeting? Whatâs your expectation for China-France relations going forward? WangâWenbin: Recently we have seen frequent high-level exchanges between China and France. President Xi Jinping had a phone conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron and reached new important common understandings on promoting the further development of China-France and China-EU relations. Premier Li Qiang met with visiting French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna, where they reviewed good practice in growing bilateral relations and agreed to further deepen mutually-beneficial cooperation. Foreign Minister WangâYiâand Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna held talks and co-chaired the 6th meeting of the China-France high-level dialogue mechanism on people-to-people exchanges. The two sides agreed to make joint efforts in the following aspects: First, we will work together for a successful year in bilateral ties. To mark the year 2024 as the China-France Year of Culture and Tourism and the 60th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic relations, the two sides will hold a host of commemorative events, act on the important common understandings reached by the two heads of state, have closer high-level exchanges and deepen practical cooperation. Second, we will deepen all-round high-quality cooperation. Both sides will continue to make full use ofâtheâthree high-level dialogue mechanisms, namely the strategic dialogue, the economic and financial dialogue, and the dialogue on people-to-people exchanges. We will also open new channels of exchanges and dialogue, deepen cooperation in traditional sectors of strength including civil nuclear energy, space and aviation, tap into potentials in emerging sectors such as education, scientific research, energy transition and sustainable development, explore third-market cooperation, and advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. Third, we will expand opening-up to each other. China stands ready to work together with France to turn the mechanism of âfrom French farms to Chinese tablesâ into a highlight in bilateral cooperation. As China continues to advance high-quality development and high-level opening-up, it stands ready to offer more opportunities to French companies interested in the Chinese market. It is hoped that France will continue to provide a sound business environment for Chinese companies. Fourth, we will jointly respond to global challenges. The two sides agreed to uphold the institutional framework of the Paris Agreement and support a successful 28th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Dubai. In April this year, the Chinese and French Presidents reached important common understandings on jointly building a China-France carbon neutrality center. During Foreign Minister Colonnaâs visit, the center was officially launched with an inauguration ceremony attended by the two foreign ministers, which sent a strong message of China and France strengthening green tech cooperation and jointly responding to climate change. At the meeting of the China-France high-level dialogue mechanism on people-to-people exchanges,âthe two foreign ministers jointly witnessed the signing of cooperation documents on education, scientific research, culture and tourism, and health, and the release of the list of high-quality cultural exchange activities between China and France in 2024. They also unveiled the logo of the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and France and the China-France Year of Culture and Tourism.âChina will grant 15-day visa-free entry for French travelers and France will issue longer visas to Chinese postgraduate students. Standing at a new historical starting point, China is ready to work with France to renew our traditional friendship and open up new prospects to make sure our comprehensive strategic partnership will be stronger and more dynamic and our cooperation will continue to lead the world. China News Service: After China announced the unilateral visa-free policy for Malaysia on November 24, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on November 26 that Malaysia will grant 30-day visa-free travel for Chinese citizens starting from December 1. What is your comment? Wang Wenbin: We welcome Malaysiaâs 30-day visa-free policy for Chinese citizens. China and Malaysia are neighbors with time-honored friendship. Earlier this year, the two countries reached important common understandings on building a China-Malaysia community with a shared future, and next year marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two countries. We believe that the recent visa facilitation policies of China and Malaysia will further boost cross-border travel between the two countries. China stands ready to work with Malaysia to continue stepping up mutually-beneficial cooperation as well as cultural and people-to-people exchange so as to deliver more fruitful outcomesâthrough friendly cooperation.  Dragon TV:âThe new government of New Zealand was officially sworn in on November 27.âNational Party leader Christopher Luxonâwas sworn in as New Zealandâs Prime Minister.âWinston Peters, leader of New Zealand First Party, became Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Wang Wenbin:âChina congratulates theânew government of New Zealandâon being sworn in. Premier of the State Council Li Qiang and Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Foreign Minister Wang Yi sent congratulatory messages to Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Winston Peters respectively. China and New Zealand are each otherâs important cooperation partners. China always values the development of China-New Zealand relations and stands ready to work with the new government of New Zealand to uphold mutual respect, equality and mutual benefits, enhance dialogue and communication, expand practical cooperation, properly settle differences and further advance the China-New Zealand comprehensive strategic partnership. Ukrainian News Agency: The Washington Post reports that Russian and Chinese executives discussedâRussia-Crimea tunnel project. But it is known that China officially recognizes Crimea as the Ukrainian peninsula, so such construction will be illegal.âWhat is the comment of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs? Wang Wenbin:âWhat the report says is groundless. I will not comment on that. CCTV: According to reports, the Al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, announced that it wouldâdelayâthe release of hostages until Israel âallows aid trucks to enter northern Gaza, accusing Israel ofâviolating theâterms regarding aid in theâceasefire agreementâand continuing to open fire.âThe Israeli militaryâsaid that itâwill immediately return to striking and operations in the Gaza Strip once the truce endsâandâthat the fighting would continue until all hostages are freed and Hamas itself is dismantled. Do you have any comment? Wang Wenbin: Since Israel and Hamas reached the ceasefire agreement, both sides have released three groups of detainees. Steps towards peace, however small, should be encouraged. Difficulties in protecting civilians, however daunting, must be overcome with every possible effort. This round of Palestinian-Israeliâconflict has continued for more than 50 days, causing great casualties and serious humanitarian disasters. As we have repeatedly stressed, violence does not bring true security and the use of force will not create lasting peace. China welcomes all efforts that are conducive to bringing about ceasefire and deescalating the situation.âWe urge parties to the conflict to earnestly implement UN Security Council Resolution 2712âandâthe resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly at its emergency special session,âjointly and effectively implement the temporary ceasefire agreement and enable it to be extended, andârealize a true and lasting ceasefire.â "

Could you share more details andâexpectations for his visit to the two countries? Mao Ning: Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are friendly neighbors and comprehensive strategic partners. At present, under the strategic leadership of President Xi Jinping, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and President Serdar Berdimuhamedov, Chinaâs relations with the two countries have grown at a high level. We are actively building a community with a shared future with both countries bilaterally. As major mechanisms for planning, guiding and coordinating bilateral cooperation, the China-Kazakhstan Cooperation Committee and the China-Turkmenistan Cooperation Committee have played a vital role in following through on the common understandings between the heads of state and promoting cooperation in various fields. Both committees are meeting in person for the first time since the pandemic. This is yet another important high-level exchange between China and Central Asian countries since the China-Central-Asia Summit in May and the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in October this year. We are convinced that the visit will surely deliver on the common understandings between the heads of state and consolidate political mutual trust, deepen all-round cooperation and add new impetus to building a closer community with a shared future between China and Kazakhstan and between China and Turkmenistan.â  Reuters: Australia confirmed today its warship named the Toowoomba transited the Taiwan Strait. Taiwanese officials said its military kept watch throughout but gave no further details. Does China have any comment on the passing of the Australian vessel? Mao Ning: Chinaâs position is clear and consistent. We urge parties concerned not to make provocations or create trouble for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

The first-ever global stocktake since the Paris Agreement came into effect will conclude at COP28, which is a key milestone for global climate governance. The UAE President sent invitation letters to President Xi Jinping for the Summit. To actively respond to climate change and to cement our traditional friendship with the UAE, Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang will attend the Summit as President Xi Jinpingâs Special Representative. China will seek efforts from various parties to uphold the institution, principles and objective of the UNFCCC system, especially the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the theme of âUnite. Act. Deliver.â so as to earnestly resolve the difficulties and issues facing developing countries and promote the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement. During the Summit, G77 will also hold the G77+China Summit and invite leaders of developing countries to attend. Reuters: Thailand expects just 3.4 to 3.5 million visitors from China this year, below its target and the 11 million Chinese visitors in pre-pandemic 2019, despite the country rolling out a visa-free program to attract Chinese tourists. Why does China think its citizens now seem less interested in traveling to Thailand? Mao Ning: China always supports and encourages more cooperation on tourism with Thailand. We look forward to more tourists visiting each otherâs countries.â  Global Times: According to reports, on November 22 local time, ROK President Yoon Suk Yeol and UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak signed The Downing Street Accord, in which the two sides state that âWe emphasise that our basic positions on Taiwan remain unchanged. Peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is an indispensable element in the security and prosperity of the international community. Given the serious nature of the situation in the East and South China Seas, we strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the region. We reiterate our firm commitment to freedom of navigation and overflight."" Whatâs your response? Mao Ning: I would like to stress that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinaâs territory. The Taiwan question is purely Chinaâs internal affair and brooks no interference by any external forces. As for issues related to the South and East China Seas, neither the ROK nor the UK is a party concerned, and there has never been any problem with regard to the âfreedom of navigation and overflightâ. China urges relevant parties to stop making irresponsible comment on issues bearing on Chinaâs core and major concerns and be very prudent about what they say or do. France 24: The French foreign ministry reiterated its condemnation of North Korea sending weapons to Russia in the context of the war in Ukraine.

"Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ningâs Regular Press Conference on November 23, 2023"," China Daily: China will hold the first China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) in Beijing with a focus on promoting global cooperation on industrial and supply chains. As the global industrial and supply chains seem to become shorter and more regional, whatâs the consideration behind hosting the expo and whatâs significant about the event? Mao Ning: The Chinese government has always been committed to keeping global industrial and supply chains stable and unfettered and taken various concrete steps to advance international cooperation on industrial and supply chains. The first China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) will open next week in Beijing. This is the worldâs first national-level expo that focuses on supply chains and an open public platform built by China to help keep global industrial and supply chains stable and functioning.

Over 500 Chinese and foreign enterprises and institutions from 55 countries and regions will participate in the expo, including Fortune 500 companies and industry leaders in the global supply chain system. Their participation fully shows that the stability of global industrial and supply chains is vital to global economic development. Itâs what the global community cares deeply about. Decoupling and supply chains disruption serve no oneâs interests and will lead nowhere. China is both a beneficiary and a defender of global supply chain integration. We remain committed to high-standard opening up and working with all countries for a safe, stable, smooth, efficient and mutually-beneficial international industrial and supply chain system. CCTV: We noted that Argentinaâs President-elect Javier Milei tweeted that he thanks President Xi Jinping for the congratulations and good wishes and would like to send him his most sincere wishes for the Chinese peopleâs wellbeing.

As we stated earlier, in the past five decades and more since China and Argentina established diplomatic ties, our two countries have always treated each other with mutual respect and equality and pursued mutual benefit. The China-Argentina friendship has taken deep roots among our peoples. It is a widely shared view in both countries that it is important to continue to advance China-Argentina relations. China stands ready to work with the new government of Argentina to renew our traditional friendship, expand mutually beneficial cooperation and advance the long-term steady growth of China-Argentina comprehensive strategic partnership to deliver greater benefits to the two peoples. Kyodo News: It has been three months since TEPCO started to dump the treated water from its nuclear power plant. Whatâs Chinaâs comment? Mao Ning: China is opposed to Japanâs discharge of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean. This is our clear position and has not changed. The ocean discharge bears on the health of all humanity, the global marine environment and the international public interest. Japan needs to take seriously the legitimate concerns both from home and abroad and properly handle this in a responsible and constructive manner.â  AFP: Jurgen Klinsmann, coach of ROK national football team, has called on the Chinese government on Wednesday to release ROK footballer Son Jun-ho in time for Christmas. Son is under investigation for suspicion of taking bribes in China. How would you respond to that and what is his condition now?â Mao Ning: We have shared information on this before. The individual concerned was arrested on suspicion of taking bribes as a person who is not a functionary of a State organ. I would refer you to competent authorities for the specific progress of the case. China is a country under the rule of law, tries cases in strict accordance with the law and protects the legal rights and interests of the individuals concerned. Bloomberg: In their meeting in San Francisco, President Xi and Prime Minister Kishida agreed to solve the Fukushima water dispute on the basis of science, according to Prime Minister Kishida. Today, Natsuo Yamaguchi, the Japanese politician, met with Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Natsuo Yamaguchi said that Wang Yi had indicated that China wanted some kind of way of verifying the water is safe thatâs coming from Fukushima. Does Wang Yiâs comments to Natsuo Yamaguchi indicate that China will participate in the IAEA monitoring process or is China looking to have some kind of separate monitoring process? Mao Ning: President Xi Jinping exchanged views on this with Japanâs Prime Minister Fumio Kishida during their meeting in the US. President Xi Jinping noted that the discharge of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water bears on the health of all humanity, the global marine environment and the international public interest. Japan should take seriously the legitimate concerns both from home and abroad and properly handle this in a responsible and constructive manner. The two sides agreed to find an appropriate way to resolve the issue of the discharge through consultation and negotiation in a constructive manner.â With more Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water being dumped into the sea, the international community has been urgently calling for an international monitoring arrangement that will remain effective over the long run. Japan needs to seriously respond to international concerns, dispose of the nuclear-contaminated water in a responsible manner, fully cooperate on putting in place an international monitoring arrangement that will remain effective over the long run with the substantive participation of all stakeholders including Japanâs neighbors, so as to avoid irrevocable consequences stemming from the ocean discharge.
